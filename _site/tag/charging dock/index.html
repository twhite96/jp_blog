            </header>

            <div class="post-content">
                <p>With the era of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/29/apple-cancels-airpower-product-citing-inability-to-meet-its-high-standards-for-hardware/">AirPower now behind us</a>, the search for the right charging dock can be an arduous process. As someone who decided not to buy anything for their desk in hopes that void could be filled with AirPower, when the cancellation of it was announced I went on the hunt to find something to replace it.</p>
<p>After some time looking at chi chargers, I wasn't impressed with any of them. Those that were appealing to the eye were not so appealing to my wallet. Eventually I decided to start looking at other options out there that are wired charging docks. Docks that have been on the market long before AirPower was even announced.</p>
<p>Whilst looking at the options, Oittm reached out to me and offered to send me their <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01NBK0STD/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_tai_EvU2Cb2TYJYGR">Aluminum Charging Dock</a> to try out. I normally don't take free merchendise to review but given my situation it seemed almost unfair to me if I said no. Two days later a package was at my home ready for me to get started putting it all together.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/45c52-oittm-charging-dock-with-phone-and-watch.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The build quality of this is a mix between aluminum base and stand with a plastic inside and top cover. On the outside sit 3 USB ports to plug in things to charge it with, and two USB ports on the inside for the Apple Watch charger and the iPhone charger to plug into. The base has a top cover hiding the small compartment where the 2 inner USB ports are, making the dock a lot less of a cable management device and more like a singular charger you can have on a desk.</p>
<p>This product has a clever way of using the wired charging cables in a way your desk still looks clean.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/3b7ff-oittm-dock-inside.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>As you can see, the dock has a hidden compartment to place the charging cables so that you can have a dock with a single power cable running around instead of several Apple cables with separate plugs for each device.</p>
<p>Once you plug in the cables and have them set up in the dock you are set to go with charging both your Apple Watch and iPhone. I will say the it wasn’t a walk in the park to plug these cables in after having already fed them through their respective charging holes. Because of the small footprint, the compartment to plug in and hide the charging cables is a bit cramped. Oittm offers cable ties for the wires you are hiding but even when wrapped and tied getting the top lid to close wasn't an easy experience. I had to carefully maneuver these wrapped cables into the USB plug and then adjust the placement of these cables to allow for them to fit in that compartment. After about 15 minutes of setting this up I finally got the lid to close and everything was working fine. Thankfully, I never have to worry about setting this thing up again, because once it’s set you’re good to go.</p>
<p>Along with the ability to charge your iPhone and Apple Watch, the Oittm Charging dock offer 3 USB ports on the back of the dock to plug in other cables to charge your other devices.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/3b9fe-image-5-8-19-3-42-am.jpeg" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-939" width="3024" height="4032" /></p>
<p>For me this was a perfect addition so that I can use a micro-USB cable to charge my Kindle and an additional lightning cable to charge my AirPods. These extra cables don't stay plugged in all the time, but when I need them it is easy to plug them in and start charging the extra devices.</p>
<p>The added ports are great when you need them, and offer zero added space when you don't, making the footprint of this dock as minimal as possible, which is preferred for my small office desk I write on. All 5 ports are powered with a single AC plug, meaning that I no longer have to have several Apple bricks plugged in to my surge protector. I instead can have a single plug to power all of my charging needs.</p>
<p>The Oittm Charging Dock isn't a wireless charger, but if you can get over that small fact, this $35 dock offers a very sleek design that can handle a lot of charging power with a small footprint. It is a perfect addition to my office desk, and I highly recommend it to anyone in the same boat as me looking for an answer to Apple's charging problem.
