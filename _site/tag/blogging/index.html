            </header>

            <div class="post-content">
                <p>I have been only using my Mac for a little while now, and one thing that I <em>love</em> about the Mac is <a href="https://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a>. This is by far my favorite app when it comes to blogging. It is dead easy to setup, and you have full control on your posts and pages without needing to use the WordPress web app. You can make pages, local drafts, and of course blog posts for your site all within MarsEdit.</p>
<p>One thing I didn’t realize about MarsEdit until I saw it in a <a href="https://red-sweater.com/blog/3502/marsedit-4-3-4-quick-fix-for-formatting-macro-crash">recent release notes page</a> is <a href="https://red-sweater.com/blog/2421/marsedit-3-5-formatting-macros-full-screen-mode-tumblr-tweaks">custom macros for formatting</a>.</p>
<p>Basically this allows you to edit the key bindings on MarsEdit for a number of built in formatting shortcuts. For example, MarsEdit ships with the Paste Link shortcut being Shift+⌘+A. As someone who is used to Ulysses and the WordPress web app I changed that shortcut to be ⌘+K instead. It is second nature for me to make that my link shortcut, and I love being able to change in MarsEdit.</p>
<p>Not only can you change baked in formatting macros, you can also make custom formatting shortcuts. To explain, let me show you how I manage my link posts introduction.</p>
<p>My link posts contain a very specific format that has come to be a standard among us Apple and Tech link bloggers which is:</p>
<p><strong>AUTHOR </strong>writing for <strong>PUBLICATION</strong>:</p>
<p>All of the above is then linked to the specific URL of the post in question.</p>
<p>To do this you first need to right click within the draft and select “Format” and then go all the way down to the bottom of the sub-list and select “Customize..."</p>
<p><img src="/assets/format-1.png" title="Format-1.png" alt="Format 1" /></p>
<p>Once there you will see all of the formatting options that are setup, including the "Link…” and “Paste Link” options I changed the shortcuts to. But for this example we want to make a new shortcut and we are going to do so by clicking the “+” button on the bottom left.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/format-list-2.png" title="Format-List-2.png" alt="Format List 2" /></p>
<p>From there you will see something like the image below, asking you for a title, shortcut, Opening Markup (what the format starts with) and a Closing Markup (what it ends with). What you see below might seem daunting, but I assure you it isn’t as hard as it looks. For one thing, there is a very cool tool in the where you can insert placeholders (see below).</p>
<p>So if you want to be prompted for text you can select “Ask for text” or if you want the URL you have in your clipboard to automatically be added, you can select “Paste URL.” In the case of this shortcut, I ask for the Author and the Publication, and with the formatting of HTML inserted within it, it takes those two inputs and the URL I have copied in my clipboard and spits out an HTML version of my link post introduction.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/format-example-3.png" title="Format Example-3.png" alt="Custom Macro Setup Screen" /></p>
<p><img src="/assets/screen-shot-2019-08-26-at-11.53.18-am.png" class="aligncenter" title="Screen Shot 2019-08-26 at 11.53.18 AM.png" alt="The placeholders you can use for custom macros" /></p>
<p><img src="/assets/format-author-4.png" title="Format Author-4.png" alt="Entering Author's Name" /></p>
<p><img src="/assets/format-publication-5.png" title="Format Publication-5.png" alt="Entering Publication" /></p>
<p><img src="/assets/format-result-6.png" title="Format Result-6.png" alt="Final Result" /></p>
<p>The best part? If you are like me and write with the WYSIWYG editor instead of the HTML editor it is automatically formatted properly. It is smart enough to know that you are writing in rich text and so it pastes it as such.</p>
<p>If you would like the specific code I used for my opening and closing you can copy it below.</p>
<p><strong>Opening Markup</strong>:</p>
<p><code>&lt;a href="#pasteurl#"&gt;#asktext author: Jeff Perry# writing for #asktext Publication#</code></p>
<p><strong>Closing Markup</strong>:</p>
<p><code>&lt;/a&gt;:</code></p>
<p><strong>Opening Markup from Video</strong>:</p>
<p><code>#asktext author: Jeff Perry# writing for &lt;a href="#pasteurl#"&gt;#asktext Publication#</code></p>
<p>Finally, I created a quick tutorial on how to use this custom shortcut. In it I mention a very cool tool call <a href="https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/">Karabiner</a>, which allows you to really dive into custom keyboard shortcuts. The most common one is a “hyper key” which transforms the Caps Lock key from making text all caps into a tool that effectively presses Shift+Command+Option+Control all in one go. It is great for when you want to use a custom keyboard shortcut but don’t want to worry about stepping on another keyboard shortcut’s toes. To do that, just download Karabiner and add the following rule under the "Complex Modifications" tab:</p>

            <div class="post-content">
                <p>I have long said that the open web is something I feel strongly about, and that in order for you to truly&nbsp;<em>own</em> something on the internet it has to be on your personal website. You can’t expect companies like Twitter, Facebook, Medium, or other big name social media platforms to care about that stuff. They should, but we all know that it is in their best nature to keep that stuff in&nbsp;<em>their</em> home turf and make it as difficult as possible to get it elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To save time, my argument for the open web boils down to this: <strong>Would you rather have all of your work in the hands of someone else, or in your own hands?</strong></p>
<p>I bring this up because Automattic, the company that owns WordPress.com, recently bought Tumblr for <a href="https://www.axios.com/verizon-tumblr-wordpress-automattic-e6645edd-bc73-45c2-9380-9fe8ca34291f.html">a reportedly $3 million steal</a> (don’t forget&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/08/13/tumblr-once-sold-billion-owner-wordpress-just-bought-site-fraction-that/?noredirect=on">Tumblr sold just a few years ago for $1.1 billion</a>). If you want to know <em>why</em> I am excited about this, and why it caused me to think about the open web, I think Aja Romano said it best in <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/8/13/20802751/wordpress-tumblr-sale-porn-ban-future">their Vox article</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>WordPress has succeeded thus far by not rocking the boat, catering to its community, and essentially doing one thing — blogging — extremely well. This would seem to make it an ideal parent for Tumblr’s more unruly, unwieldy blog format, which gave the world the “reblog” and made use of universalized tagging systems to connect its noisy user base. WordPress, with no reblogs, has a much less streamlined tagging system, and its “blogroll” approach to connecting users feels hopelessly outdated. In essence, each company has things to teach the other about blogging.</p>
<p>“I don’t think there’s any organic connection between the two platforms,” Dash told me, “though I do hope Automattic updates WordPress’s feature for reading blogs to be as good as Tumblr’s timeline.”</p>
<p>Where WordPress excels over Tumblr, however, is in respecting and following its community’s lead on things like site design. One of the foundations of its success is <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/">its commitment</a> to open source web design, meaning anyone can make and customize their own WordPress website theme. We might say Tumblr is something of an open source community too, with the ecosystem flourishing and growing most when it’s able to be artistically inventive and essentially bend Tumblr’s format in new and interesting directions. (For instance, the site was initially intended to be a “microblog,” closer in spirit to Twitter’s original 180-character limit; instead, Tumblr users made the platform well-known for long, image-heavy posts, subcultural artistic movements, and animated GIF storytelling.) Tumblr’s corporate overlords have had significant trouble with this notion in the past, but supporting a more hands-off community is not something that should give Automattic much trouble.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For further information on the deal, there's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/14/20804894/tumblr-acquisition-matt-mullenweg-ceo-automattic-wordpress-verizon-changes-vergecast">a recent Vergecast where they interviewed</a> Automattic’s CEO, Matt Mullenweg, I left that podcast wanting to directly support WordPress; so I did. I moved my website from <a href="https://www.easywp.com">EasyWP</a> on NameCheap to WordPress hosting through WordPress.com. To be honest I thought about checking out Tumblr, but as someone who has never tried it, I thought diving in now for my personal site would be overkill.</p>
<p>The cost to move to WordPress.com was a bit more than what I was paying previous (almost double), and the functionality isn’t as flexible as the self-hosted websites are, but with the bad comes a lot of good. For one, I no longer have to worry about my website being optimized properly, and if I have any issues I can contact one of WordPress’ Happiness Engineers (which is a great job title if you ask me) for assistance. So far the response time has been much less than it would have taken services like Squarespace or NameCheap to help me with technical support. The move was simple, thanks to already having a WordPress website, and when I needed clarification it was handled in hours, not days.</p>
<p>I personally feel like this move is better for me in the long run. I get to worry less about making my website “perfect” every 6 weeks and instead start working on what should matter the most: writing; which I hope to do more of going forward.</p>

                <p>Something about this video makes me realize the <em>real</em> reason I am blogging on Rocket Panda instead of something like SquareSpace or Tumblr. It isn't because I think WordPress is a better platform, that is debatable on many different levels. The reason is because it’s <em>my</em> platform. I own every pixel of this website and I can control what goes on here and what doesn't.</p>
<p>This isn't about WordPress though, it is about the open web. If you are unsure what the open web is, I will let Mark Surman, Executive Director of the <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/">Mozilla Foundation</a>, explain.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.yearofopen.org/november-open-perspective-what-is-open-web/what-is-the-open-web-and-why-is-it-important-submitted-by-mark-surman-executive-director-of-the-mozilla-foundation/">Mark Surman writing on Year of Open</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <strong>What is Open Web?</strong></p>
<p>  “Open web” is a sweeping term — it encompasses technical concepts like open-source code and open standards. It also encompasses democratic concepts like free expression and digital inclusion.</p>
<p>  But there’s a single underlying principle connecting all these ideas: An open web is a web by and for all its users, not select gatekeepers or governments.</p>
<p>  At Mozilla, we compare the open web to a global public resource, like clean water or the environment. The open web is something we all depend on: to communicate and create, to work and play, to buy and sell. And like any other natural resource, it’s fragile. It needs care, because it can be polluted: by harassment and abuse, by misinformation, by bad public policy.</p>
<p>  <strong>Why is it important?</strong></p>
<p>  The web doesn’t exist in a vacuum, or apart from society. The two are deeply entwined. The web is where we engage with journalism, form opinions and share knowledge. It’s an arena for politics, education, culture and science.</p>
<p>  An open web means positive progress for all these things. A more informed public; more civic participation; more opportunities to learn and connect with each other.</p>
<p>  An unhealthy web has an opposite effect. When misinformation, harassment or surveillance proliferate online, we lose trust in our institutions and in each other. Fewer people engage. And when closed, proprietary technology proliferates, innovation and competition are stifled. The web is no longer a level playing field — it’s a platform controlled by a select few.
</p></blockquote>
<p>While the main issue is governments seeking control of the internet, another entity is at work to wall up our content and lives: social media. I read somewhere a long time ago that you can't be playing in someone else's yard and then get upset when they kick you off it.</p>
<p>If Facebook one day decides that they want to close up shop all of the photos, posts, videos, status updates, and events you have put there are susceptible of going away forever. While losing a large part of your digital life can be catastrophic the thing that I think is much more dangerous is the freedoms you are giving up as a cost of entry into Facebook and Twitter and Instagram.</p>
<p>These social media giants aren't making these social networks just so you can stay in touch with friends and family, it is to get data and demographic information for marketing and advertisers. You are the product, and the more information these companies can get on you the better.</p>
<p>That said, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/sign-in-with-apple/">Apple is planning to launch Sign In with Apple</a> soon and that is a game changer in my opinion. You no longer have to use your personal information to log in to a service. You can now use great services online and in the App Store <em>without</em> having to worry about privacy concerns. This is the digital version of having your cake and eating it too.</p>
<p>I plan to remove every piece of my Facebook the moment I get married this summer. I no longer want to be a part of a company I deem to be evil, and I don’t want to keep feeding them my personal data for a myriad of reasons.</p>
<p>I guess what I am trying to say is when I want to share something on the internet I am going to do it on Rocket Panda, and I hope that you consider doing the same for your stuff.</p>

            <div class="post-content">
                <p>I recently took <a href="https://thesweetsetup.com/ulysses/?utm_source=hello_bar">a course</a> by <a href="https://shawnblanc.net">Shawn Blanc</a> about <a href="http://ulysses.app">Ulysses</a> and learned <em>a ton</em> about the premium writing application, but one thing that I loved just as much were the extra emails Shawn sent out after I purchased the course.</p>
<p>My main takeaways from the emails he sent were these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t overthink things</li>
<li>Make the time to write</li>
<li>Give yourself permission to be crappy</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these things are useful for someone like me who writes for fun and as a hobby on Rocket Panda. Honestly its just plain good advice for anyone doing something creative whether it is for a job or a hobby. I frequently look at these pieces of advice Shawn expressed and it makes me think about the one thing that I want to do more of as a blogger: <strong>consistency</strong>.</p>
<p>These four pieces of advice are perfectly in sync with my main issues in posting more frequently and making writing a daily habit for myself.</p>
<h2>Don’t Overthink Things</h2>
<p>One of the biggest reasons I’m not writing and posting consistently is because when I begin writing a post I make sure it is <em>absolutely perfect</em> and I overthink the point of why I am writing on Rocket Panda in the first place.</p>
<p>I created Rocket Panda because I wanted to share ideas, thoughts, and interesting things with like-minded people. People who love technology, automation, Apple, and other geeky things. I never got into this “blogging scene” to become rich and famous, I did it because I wanted a way to eexpress my love and interests with others.</p>
<p>There is <a href="https://youtu.be/krK4YJgYPGc">a great video by Sean McCabe</a> that is all about overthinking things and how creative people should stop doing it.</p>
<p>At first I thought this is something that’s easier said than done. After all, Sean has a successful business and podcast and I feel like I have hit a wall when it comes to growth in readers for Rocket Panda. After some time feeling sorry for myself, I realized that this goes in tandem with posting frequently and showing up every day to make those consistent posts happen. I know that the idea of “if you build it they will come” isn’t something that is always true, but it doesn't hurt to hit deadlines and make posting something you have in a calendar. If I say I will have a post live on a specific day I am more likely to post it rather than hitting publish after weeks of spending meticulous time making sure everything is <em>absolutely perfect</em>.</p>
<p>So instead of making things “perfect” I plan to make frequency and deadlines be my determining factor of when to publish. If the clock is racing and I don’t feel good about something I’m writing I am more likely to improve it <em>and still</em> hit my deadline in the process.</p>
<h2>Make the Time to Write</h2>
<p>When it comes to any craft you want to get better at, you have to make it something you do regularly. If you don’t then you’ll never improve in any significant way. This isn’t anything new for me but it is something I am reminding myself when it comes to writing. Which is why my goal every day is to write 500 crappy words at a minimum.</p>
<p>If I want to hit that goal of 500 words a day, I need to show up every day to write, and right now it just isn’t happening.</p>
<p>The thing that helped me with this valley of nothing was <a href="https://youtu.be/GExHiI_bQqc">Merlin Mann’s talk at MacWorld in 2009 about the patterns for creativity</a>. I have this video starting at 18:15 because this is where the nut of what got me started. The only thing you really need to know is that there is a book called <em>Creative Habit</em> by Twyla Tharp and when she is asked to do a project she uses these boxes where she does this thing called “scratching” which is her putting literally anything and everything that brings her inspiration. I recommend watching the whole thing to fully understand things but that is the very brief version of what led to this 5 minute section of the talk.</p>

<p>There’s a lot to unpack in this talk, and maybe I will write more about it someday, but this got me thinking about why I haven’t been making the time to write. It was because I didn't want it enough.</p>
<p>This isn’t me saying you have to go all-in and work 18 hour days to make your dreams come true, but it is me saying that I spent more time trying to find inspiration from writers and bloggers who were at the level I wanted to be at. I was gawking at their work online wishing I was where they were instead of making the stuff I wanted to make. That isn't their fault though, it’s mine. I cared more about the idea of blogging and writing than actually putting in the work and making a commitment to myself to keep working on the things I want to be better at.</p>
<h2>Give Yourself Permission to be Crappy</h2>
<p>I am not as strong a writer as I would like to be, but if I allow that distance between where I am and where I want to be affect me then I would never write again. The only way that you can get better at a craft is to keep doing it over and over again and learn from your mistakes.</p>
<p>I think it’s been made painfully clear that I am a perfectionist and I never allowed myself to just be okay with mediocrity, let alone being crappy. Still, I think if I allow myself to write 500 crappy words a day I will get better faster than if I wrote 1000 good words every few weeks.</p>
<p>Being perfect is overrated in my opinion. I say that knowing full well that has been what I’ve been striving for the last year writing on my blog. Honestly it’s just exhausting reading over your work a dozen times and making small and unnecessary edits. That said, there is a difference between being perfect and having something presentable.</p>
<p>This isn’t me saying that I will be drafting something up without proofreading and multiple edits. I still plan to do the work of combing through for errors and mispellings. The part I <em>won’t</em> be doing is going through what I have written actively looking for something to change just to change it. I want to <a href="https://jeffperry.blog/2019/04/keeping-it-simple/">keep things simple</a>.</p>
<h2>Changes for Rocket Panda</h2>
<p>All of this has come to a head for me and there are some changes effective today that will be taking place at Rocket Panda.</p>
<h3>1. I Will Write at Least 30 Minutes Every Day</h3>
<p>Now, 30 minutes doesn’t sound like a lot, but with that low bar of entry I have no excuse for myself to make the time to write every single day for 30 minutes. I have found if I spend that amount of time writing I am able to shake the cobwebs off and really start diving into more focused writing.</p>
<h3>2. I Will Post <em>at Least</em> Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday</h3>
<p>I will make a total of 3 posts a week on Rocket Panda. I may post more, but I am committing to 3. They might just be links to things I find interesting or longer articles that I spend lots of time writing. Either way I have set the precedent that I am posting on specific days and that this is my new posting schedule.</p>
<p>If I’m being honest, this is a safe space after all, I wanted to commit to more than 3 posts a week. I wanted to go daily but I know that the one day I miss posting I will kick myself for it and lose all sense of control. I have been there before and I stopped writing for weeks because I was too busy beating myself up for not meeting the exceedingly high bar I set myself. I want to avoid that this time so I have lowered the bar for myself and will start out with 3 posts a week and see where things take me afterwards.</p>
<p>The first post of the week starts today with this one. The next scheduled post will be Wednesday.</p>
<h2>One More Thing</h2>
<p>One of the biggest things that I want to stress and put out there for both you and me is that it is okay to not think that what you are putting out there is perfect. Perfection is what stifles my creativity and my writing process every single time I let it take precedent. I can’t move on to the next post until I make it published, and I won’t publish unless it is perfect. <strong>Screw being perfect</strong>, if I look back on my work and think I could have said it better that only means that I am improving on my craft.</p>
<p>So with these new promises I hope to achieve the goal I have wanted for a while and post consistently and create without overthinking things. If I can do that this year I would consider it a success.</p>
