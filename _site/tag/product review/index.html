            </header>

            <div class="post-content">
                <p>With the era of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/29/apple-cancels-airpower-product-citing-inability-to-meet-its-high-standards-for-hardware/">AirPower now behind us</a>, the search for the right charging dock can be an arduous process. As someone who decided not to buy anything for their desk in hopes that void could be filled with AirPower, when the cancellation of it was announced I went on the hunt to find something to replace it.</p>
<p>After some time looking at chi chargers, I wasn't impressed with any of them. Those that were appealing to the eye were not so appealing to my wallet. Eventually I decided to start looking at other options out there that are wired charging docks. Docks that have been on the market long before AirPower was even announced.</p>
<p>Whilst looking at the options, Oittm reached out to me and offered to send me their <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01NBK0STD/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_tai_EvU2Cb2TYJYGR">Aluminum Charging Dock</a> to try out. I normally don't take free merchendise to review but given my situation it seemed almost unfair to me if I said no. Two days later a package was at my home ready for me to get started putting it all together.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/45c52-oittm-charging-dock-with-phone-and-watch.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The build quality of this is a mix between aluminum base and stand with a plastic inside and top cover. On the outside sit 3 USB ports to plug in things to charge it with, and two USB ports on the inside for the Apple Watch charger and the iPhone charger to plug into. The base has a top cover hiding the small compartment where the 2 inner USB ports are, making the dock a lot less of a cable management device and more like a singular charger you can have on a desk.</p>
<p>This product has a clever way of using the wired charging cables in a way your desk still looks clean.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/3b7ff-oittm-dock-inside.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>As you can see, the dock has a hidden compartment to place the charging cables so that you can have a dock with a single power cable running around instead of several Apple cables with separate plugs for each device.</p>
<p>Once you plug in the cables and have them set up in the dock you are set to go with charging both your Apple Watch and iPhone. I will say the it wasn’t a walk in the park to plug these cables in after having already fed them through their respective charging holes. Because of the small footprint, the compartment to plug in and hide the charging cables is a bit cramped. Oittm offers cable ties for the wires you are hiding but even when wrapped and tied getting the top lid to close wasn't an easy experience. I had to carefully maneuver these wrapped cables into the USB plug and then adjust the placement of these cables to allow for them to fit in that compartment. After about 15 minutes of setting this up I finally got the lid to close and everything was working fine. Thankfully, I never have to worry about setting this thing up again, because once it’s set you’re good to go.</p>
<p>Along with the ability to charge your iPhone and Apple Watch, the Oittm Charging dock offer 3 USB ports on the back of the dock to plug in other cables to charge your other devices.</p>

<p>For me this was a perfect addition so that I can use a micro-USB cable to charge my Kindle and an additional lightning cable to charge my AirPods. These extra cables don't stay plugged in all the time, but when I need them it is easy to plug them in and start charging the extra devices.</p>
<p>The added ports are great when you need them, and offer zero added space when you don't, making the footprint of this dock as minimal as possible, which is preferred for my small office desk I write on. All 5 ports are powered with a single AC plug, meaning that I no longer have to have several Apple bricks plugged in to my surge protector. I instead can have a single plug to power all of my charging needs.</p>
<p>The Oittm Charging Dock isn't a wireless charger, but if you can get over that small fact, this $35 dock offers a very sleek design that can handle a lot of charging power with a small footprint. It is a perfect addition to my office desk, and I highly recommend it to anyone in the same boat as me looking for an answer to Apple's charging problem.

            <div class="post-content">
                <p>The Apple Pencil is a great tool when you need it, but when you don&rsquo;t it can be more of an inconvenience than anything. This is why there are <em>so many</em> Pencil cases and products to allow you to store the pencil when you don&rsquo;t need it.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_385878">Apple joined this game last year with <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MQ0W2ZM/A/apple-pencil-case-midnight-blue">their own case</a>. But there was one problem: it provided no function for transporting it. To do that you would need to buy Apple&rsquo;s $129.00 <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MPU12ZM/A/leather-sleeve-for-105%E2%80%91inch-ipad-pro-saddle-brown">leather sleeve</a>. I don&rsquo;t know about you, but if I have to buy something that costs more than my Apple Pencil to just keep it near my iPad it isn&rsquo;t for me. With that out as an option, I still needed a sleek, high functioning holster for my Pencil.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_385887">This is where <a href="http://twelvesouth.com/">Twelve South</a>&nbsp;comes in with their new product, the <a href="https://www.twelvesouth.com/product/pencilsnap">PencilSnap</a></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_385895">I recently bought my own PencilSnap to see if this would be the final accessory I would need to carry my Apple Pencil once and for all. I have to say, this little piece of leather has a lot going for it.</p>
<h2 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_385898">Look and Feel</h2>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_385901">This holster is very minimal looking and there is no noticeable branding on the product at first glance. However, If you look on the back of it where there are magnets to stick it on a Smart Cover to Smart Keyboard you can see the word PencilSnap embossed on the leather. It is a very subtle but nice touch that is something I wish other brands would do on their products.<code><br />
</code></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_385907">The leather the PencilSnap is made out of is well crafted to say the least. It has the feel of fresh leather you would get from an Apple branded iPhone case. I haven&rsquo;t had it long enough to see how this leather ages over time but if the photos I see of leather iPhone cases on Reddit indicates anything, it is going to look even better after some time and use. I will say that it takes a few time of putting it in and taking the Apple Pencil out for the leather to loosen up. Honestly this was fine after about a dozen time of me taking it out.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_385910">The backing with the magnets is firm but mailable enough to really allow you to pull your pencil in an out without worrying that you are going to break the case. It also bounces back very nicely, leaving my worries of it being forever bent backwards behind.</p>
<h2 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_385913">Functionality</h2>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_385916">This thing is crazy strong. Both with the magnets keeping it on the iPad and the overall casing for the Pencil. I have vigorously shaken the case with the pencil in it and it just doesn&rsquo;t budge. the PencilSnap does its job well and without any margin of error.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_385919">I also have had the case on my iPad 10.5&rdquo; Smart Keyboard and took a shake to that as well, way more than I would actually jostle my iPad in day-to-day use. Again, not a single budge. I wanted to see just how far I had to take things in order to get these magnets to fail.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_385922">So I removed the Smart Keyboard from my iPad and unfurled it to have one long silicone case and a keyboard and shook it like a mad man. Finally, after a few good shakes the force of the case whipping back and forth made it fly off the case. So if you end up whipping your Smart Cover around like it&rsquo;s a bed sheet, this magnet won&rsquo;t work. But if you aren&rsquo;t insane, and you treat your tablet with even a little respect this thing won&rsquo;t fail on you.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_385925">If I find any issues with this over time I will be sure to update this post and let you know, but honestly I don&rsquo;t foresee me having to do that. I am utterly impressed with just how sleek yet strong Twelve South made this.</p>
<h2 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_385928">Conclusion</h2>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_385931">If you aren&rsquo;t satisfied with how you are using your Apple Pencil for travel or just want something to keep your Apple Pencil with your iPad Pro, this $30 accessory will be the only thing you need. It keeps it close to your iPad and safely attached. I would recommend this over Apple&rsquo;s case, or really any other Apple Pencil case, with zero hesitation.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_385934">Twelve South continues to uphold their reputation as one of the leading Apple accessory manufacturers because they sweat the details, and make sure products like the PencilSnap make your life easier and look great too.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_385937">You can pick up your own PencilSnap at <a href="https://www.twelvesouth.com/product/pencilsnap">Twelve South&rsquo;s website</a> for just $1 more than Apple&rsquo;s and get <strong>ten times</strong> more use out of it.</p>
