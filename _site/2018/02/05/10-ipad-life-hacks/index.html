        <h2 itemprop="name headline">10 iPad Life Hacks</h2>
    </header>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>When you are working with your iPad, many people feel stuck. Some feel like they aren&rsquo;t being efficient enough or doing the right things. Well, today we have 10 ipad life hacks on how to get more out of your favorite iPad.</p>
<h2 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345521">1. Type to Siri</h2>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345524">Type to Siri is a new addition to iOS 11. And if you are like so many others, you usually have a keyboard attached or connected to the iPad. So, instead of talking to Siri you can type to her (or him).</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345527">This is great for the people who aren&rsquo;t into talking to a computer to do tasks, it is also great for those night owls who don&rsquo;t want to wake anyone that may be sleeping in your home.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345530">Give type to Siri a try, it may just be the extra kick you need to getting things out of your head and into a system you trust.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345533">To do this go into <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Accessibility</strong> &gt; <strong>Siri</strong></p>
<p>From there turn on Type to Siri.<code><br />
</code></p>
<h2 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345539">2. Have a shelf app in Slide-Over<code><br />
</code></h2>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345545">I spoke about Shelf Apps before. They are a great way to put things you want to save and use in other apps for later. One trick I found to be immensely helpful it to always have it available with a simple swipe from the right side of the iPad.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345551">This is called the Slide-Over app. It is basically a floating app that isn&rsquo;t connected to another app, allowing it to be freely accessible wherever you are on you iPad.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345554">I use this a lot with the images to my posts, but I have seen others use it for practically any type of file or input.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345557">If you are looking for a good Shelf app I recommend <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gladys/id1257526927?mt=8&amp;at=1000lHAf">Gladys</a> or <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yoink-improved-drag-and-drop/id1260915283?mt=8&amp;at=1000lHAf">Yoink</a>. Each have their quirks but they are both very powerful and definitely something I keep in my dock for frequent use.</p>
<h2 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345566">3. Use Spotlight for searching more than just apps<code><br />
</code></h2>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345572">Spotlight is underutilized, in my opinion, when it comes to using the iPad. Many just use it for the occasional search for an app, but there are so many other things that Spotlight can search for.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345575">You can search for files, websites, and even local stores through Maps. Spotlight is something I underutilized until I started pushing to see what all it can handle. I was beyond pleasantly surprised to see that it managed to find what I wanted a large majority of the time.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345578">Granted, there are times where I couldn&rsquo;t find what I was searching for but that happened far less then when it worked.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345581">Give Spotlight a try more and see it it works for you.</p>
<h2 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345584">4. Edit your Share sheet</h2>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345587">The Share Sheet is the place to send things from one app to another. But sometimes you have to dig through to find the right app to send the information or file to.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345590">One thing you can do is remove the apps you never use in the Share Sheet. You can do this by hitting the share icon and scrolling all the way to the right and tap the &ldquo;More&rdquo; button.<code><br />
</code></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345596">From there you can rearrange, hide, or add the apps you want. This works for both the top and bottom rows of the Share Sheet.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345599">Additionally, you can drag icons to rearrange them if you find you want one more readily accessible.</p>
<h2 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345602">5. Use text shortcuts and/or TextExpander<code><br />
</code></h2>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345608">Many of us have common phrases or information we send to people regularly. Things like email addresses, updates on where we are, or just emails we send when someone asks a question you get asked a lot. This is where Text Replacement and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/textexpander-keyboard/id1075927186?mt=8&amp;at=1000lHAf">TextExpander</a> come in.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345614">Text Replacement is a feature built into iOS. To see it go to <strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; Keyboard</strong> and you will see the option there. Once you open it you can add or edit text replacements. One you may see there is omw. What this means is that any time you type &ldquo;omw&rdquo; iOS will replace that with &ldquo;On my way!&rdquo;</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345617">Text Replacement is useful for quick phrases or words that you may use a lot, but when you add longer strands of text or need something that is Rick Text, you will need TextExpander.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345620">TextExpander is a great tool I recommend to anyone who does email support, communicates to others via email or text as part of their job, or just someone that is geeky like my and wants to make things easier for me in the long run.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345623">Because of the robust features TextExpander offer you may need some help getting over the learning curve of it. David Sparks did <a href="https://www.macsparky.com/blog/2016/4/new-textexpander-and-video-series">a video series on Textexpander</a> a little over a year ago when the company redesigned their app from the ground up. If you want to learn more about the vast amount of features this app has, David is the man to teach you.</p>
<h2 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345629">6. Edit Control Center<code><br />
</code></h2>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345635">Control Center is one of those features that if you use it, it can make things much more efficient and change the way you use your iPhone or iPad.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345638">When iOS 11 came out Apple put together a slew of options you can set for your Control Center, including having up to 8 button instead of the default 4. There are some great options on there, my personal favorite is the screen recording option. With this you just tap on the button and you screen is then being recorded. This is especially handy when you are the tech support person for your family and a relative asks you how to do something on their phone. Instead of walking them through it with long texts or emails you can record how to do it and send it their way to view as many times as they need to accomplish what they want.</p>
<h2 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345641">7. Schedule Do Not Disturb times for working on the high-energy level tasks<code><br />
</code></h2>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345647">Do Not Disturb sounds like a feature you would use when you are going to sleep or when you&rsquo;re at the movies, but this feature can cut distractions out of your life big time.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345650">I use DND when I am writing or working on other high-energy tasks that require my full attention. It saves me from being distracted by email, messages, and more when I am in deep work mode.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345653">If you want to learn more about what Do Not Disturb is, Apple has a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204321">great support doc</a> to read over.</p>
<h2 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345659">8. Long Press on some Apps for a force-touch like response<code><br />
</code></h2>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345665">While the new iPhones have Force Touch, the iPad does not. Regardless of the reasoning from Apple, there is a way to get the added pop-ups on an iPad.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345668">This doesn&rsquo;t work for all apps that have force touch support, but those that do have it allows you to use it without having to open the app.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345671">Just tap and hold on an app, instead of it wiggling a pop-up will appear with whatever the developers built to come up. For instance, Apple&rsquo;s Files app shows the most recent documents you have opened, which can be handy when you need to quickly open up something you were working on earlier.</p>
<h2 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345674">9. Scan QR codes with your Camera<code><br />
</code></h2>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345680">QR codes were never the smash hit they were meant to be. Rarely do I ever use it, but on the rare occasion I do I always thought you needed to download a separate app. Instead, you have a QR code reader built in to the camera.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345683">With a few taps in settings you too can turn on QR Code reader and have the option to scan one within the native Camera app.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345686">Apparently this feature was added with iOS 11. It is a hidden feature to many, but this is so convenient when necessary.</p>
<h2 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345689">10. Access Saved Passwords in Safari<code><br />
</code></h2>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345695">Password management has become more and more important over the years. Between hacks to your email, or even your personal finance information, a good password that is unique on each site is a must.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345698">Safari has made some major improvements to creating passwords for accounts you make in the browser, making them uniques and then saving them to iCloud.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345701">But there are times where you need that password and iOS doesn&rsquo;t have it as an option in the shortcut menu. You&rsquo;re not out of luck, you just need to copy it from Settings.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345704">To do this go to <strong>Settings &gt; Accounts &amp; Passwords</strong> then tap on the App &amp; Website Passwords option at the top. From there you will get access to all the saved passwords in you iCloud Keychain.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345707">While the iCloud Keychain can get the job done it doesn&rsquo;t offer many options for other things like secure notes, and getting to these passwords can be tedious over time.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345710">This is where apps like <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1password/id568903335?mt=8&amp;at=1000lHAf">1Password</a> come in and they offer a great app that can be built into the Share Sheet and is integrated in may apps like Twitter where you jut tap on the lock button in the login screen and it will search for passwords that match Twitter. It is a very intuitive app and well worth the money to ease the stresses of password management and security.</p>
<h2 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345716">Extras</h2>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345719">So there are some life hacks for using you iPhone or iPad. Let me know in the comments or <a href="http://twitter.com/tablethabit">on Twitter</a> if we missed something.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_345725">Also, if you&rsquo;re wondering how I made these screenshot annotations, I used the app <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/annotable-annotation-markup/id1099850421?mt=8&amp;at=1000lHAf">Annotable</a>. They are not a sponsor, just a very cool app and one I want to share with you all!</p>
