        <p>
				Adobe recently announced that <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/adobe-unveils-photoshop-for-ipad-launching-in-2019/">Photoshop is coming to the iPad</a>, and with that comes talk of how the iPad is once again on the precipice of gaining the ability to be a &ldquo;Mac replacement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For me, this seems a bit trite and something that isn&rsquo;t a matter of if or when, the iPad <em>is</em> a Mac replacement if I ever saw one. In fact, I have been using my iPad as a main computer once again since the release of iOS 12. I haven&rsquo;t picked up my Mac for more than a few minutes a handful of times.</p>
<p>I do still use my Mac, don&rsquo;t get me wrong, and I think it is an amazing machine. With that said, it isn&rsquo;t necessary for my workflow of writing, reading RSS feeds, designing minimal graphics, and managing the backend of my websites. All of this can be done on my iPad with ease.</p>
<p>So why did I decide to crack open my Mac? Because when I needed to do something quick, it was easier for me to use a Mac app that I was already familiar with than to try and find a solution on my iPad that would have made this quick thing I had to do an entire project. If I really wanted to go iPad only, those quick and easy things I do on my Mac would become projects and learning sessions on my iPad. It isn&rsquo;t impossible, but it isn&rsquo;t something that I can make time for right now.</p>
<p>With all this said, there are times where I will make a conscious effort to make the switch from an app on the Mac to something on my iPad. A recent example of this is going from Adobe Photoshop on my Mac for graphic design to <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/affinity-designer/id1274090551?mt=8">Affinity Designer</a> on the iPad.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1485" src="/assets/Affinity-Designer-Sample-Lion.png" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></p>
<p>The reason for this is two-fold. The first being that I wanted to make more logos and designs with an app that is actually meant for designing rather than using a photo editing tool as a means to making logos. Adobe Illustrator came to mind, but I have had issues with RAM on my Mac when using that app on my Mac. So, I decided to look into other alternatives and Affinity Designer was one that I felt was an obvious leader for the iPad. It had all the features I would want a Pro app to have, tutorials to make my life easier when learning this new system, and an affordable price tag to $19.99.</p>
<p>After downloading the app, I spent an hour or so watching tutorials and just playing around with the application to get a grip on what all this system can use and what things I could look into for my own work. The UI is brilliantly placed and allowed for a busy and cramped space to look like it was crafted specifically for the iPad instead of cramming a desktop version of an app into a smaller screen haphazardly.</p>
<p>The apps Affinity has put together allow for it to be a seamless and simple solutions for people looking for a pro application to edit photos and design works of art, but they aren&rsquo;t the only ones.</p>
<p>Apps like <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lumafusion/id1062022008?mt=8">Lumafusion</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ferrite-recording-studio/id1018780185?mt=8">Ferrite</a> also allow those working with video and audio to be iPad only as well. They not only are great solutions for using an iPad for videos and podcasts, it can be your main way of editing. The Mac isn&rsquo;t necessary anymore to make that YouTube Video or create the podcast you always wanted to. It wasn&rsquo;t that long ago when you needed a high-end iMac or Mac Pro to edit videos to meet the expectations of critics and film reviewers, and most importantly <strong>ourselves</strong>. You go on YouTube now and look at videos made entirely on the iPad and they are some of the most creative and impressive pieces of art I have seen online in the past 18&#x2013;24 months. One I highly recommend is that of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfrAWqUPcFg">Serenity Caldwell&rsquo;s iPad Review</a>.</p>
<p>There are a lot of premium apps with premium prices on the iPad, but not nearly enough for everyone to see that the iPad is a &ldquo;Mac replacement.&rdquo; Personally, I think it would be better to see apps like Logic Pro X and Final Cut X get full versions of the apps on iOS. Having Apple tout that the iPad is a great alternative to the Mac and Windows Tablets but not have the premium apps to back it seems counterintuitive to me and I think for people to look at the iPad more than a Facebook and Netflix machine, they hav to put their money where their mouths are.</p>
<p>Despite my criticism on Apple not providing apps that are pro apps, I will say that there is no tablet in the Android, Chromebook, and probably the Windows ecosystem, that is as beautifully designed and well thought out as those on the iOS ecosystem, especially the iPad. If I were to look for something like Affinity Designer and Lumafusion in a Tablet form I sincerely doubt I would find anything that is as close to the intersection of beauty and function like those available on the iPad.</p>
<p>If ever there were a time to think about replacing that old MacBook Air with an iPad, I would say that time is now. With Adobe releasing more iPad apps in 2019 and almost certainly <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/new-ipad-pro-2018-all-the-rumors-on-specs-price-new-apple-pencil-possible-october-debut/">new iPads coming in the next month or two</a>, I think right now is the perfect time to think about what you can do with the iPad and really consider if it can be a replacement for you in your day to day work and life. For me, it absolutely is. I may crack open my Mac once in a while but it by no means is because I <em>need</em> it, it is just that I don&rsquo;t have the time to learn how to work around those specific things I use my Mac for still. One day I think I will, and probably have an easier time with it thanks to iOS apps like Drafts 5 and Siri Shortcuts to make things as easy as one singular tap.</p>
<p>Pro apps on the iPad are here to stay, and I think having Adobe coming into the game to bring full-featured versions of their apps is a great thing for iOS and the iPad.		</p>
