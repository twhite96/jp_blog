    </header>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>
				If ever there was a time for me to talk about keyboards it is now that I have my Brydge Series II in hand.  This keyboard was something that I was long waiting for and now that I have it in hand I think this is the perfect keyboard for me.</p>
<h2>My History with Brydge</h2>
<p>I was wary of this purchase after having more than my fair share of issues with the original keyboard Brydge came out with for the 10.5 iPad Pro. I had to send it back 3 times and after the 3rd time there was no charm and I eventually told Brydge to refund me in full. I was left with a horrible taste in my mouth from this company and I vowed to never give them my money ever again.</p>
<p>That all went out the window after hearing about the new Series II from Brydge and how it seemingly fixed all of its quality problems I had previously. I was elated to hear this and after some thought I decided to make one final exception for Brydge and gave them my money, and boy am I glad that I did.</p>
<h2>The Pros</h2>
<p>The Brydge Series II looks identical to the form factor of the original, the only thing that changed was the reliability of this keyboard was increased exponentially. No keys would fail to type, there were no more sticky keys, and the Bluetooth connection stayed true. It worked perfectly.</p>
<p>The Brydge keyboard has loads of features and checks every 99% of the boxes I had when it comes to a keyboard for the iPad.</p>
<p>The first is the layout of the keyboard allows me to touch type without issue and allows me to really fly on this thing without worrying if the key I am wanting to write with is going to work correctly or not. Not to mention, this keyboard doesn&rsquo;t skimp out on anything, offering media keys and having arrow keys that aren&rsquo;t squished and difficult to feel for. Finally, it has a dedicated home button to go back to the home screen with one press and to the multitasking view with two.</p>

<p>Not only is the keyboard layout something that warms my heart, the fact that this offers backlit keys is also a treasure to me. It is still something that baffles me to see Apple only offer backlit keys on MacBooks and never on a Wireless keyboard. I know that because of the size of the Smart Keyboards it isn&rsquo;t feasible, but if Apple were to update their Magic Keyboard to offer backlit keys it would have been an instant-buy from me. I don&rsquo;t use backlit keys often, but when I need it and not have it a small part of my brain goes berserk. Having my keys backlit allows me to write late at night while my fianc&eacute; sleeps and not have to have any house lights on<sup><a id="ffn1" href="#fn1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<h2>Downsides</h2>
<p>The only downside I found with this keyboard, like so many others I have tried, is that it is Bluetooth instead of using the iPad Pro Smart Connectors. Seeing that this keyboard is specifically made for the 10.5&rdquo; iPad it makes sense to me to have the connection to the keyboard be the Smart Connector instead. With that said, no one other than Apple and Logitech have ever made attempts to use the Smart Connector.nAfter speaking with a Brydge representative their reasoning actually made a lot of sense saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Here at Brydge we deliberately chose to use the Bluetooth 3.0 over the Apple Smart Connector as this technology does not limit our fundamental design. The Apple Smart Connector restricts the experience to a single viewing angle, while the Bluetooth 3.0 enables the flexibility to deliver a unique laptop like 180 degrees viewing angle.
</p></blockquote>
<p>With this in mind, this decision is actually something I feel is the better choice than to make the iPad only viewable in one angle. Even with the new Smart Keyboard, there are only two angles, one of which could be argued that is never used. So seeing that Bluetooth was the better option, it makes sense that is what Brydge went with instead of the Apple Smart Connector.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>It is clear that Brydge has made gigantic strides to right the wrongs they may have inadvertently made in older models of their keyboards, and it is a breath of fresh air to see a company that cares so much about design be equally caring on the quality of their new products. As someone who has an &ldquo;older&rdquo; iPad Pro, seeing them update their products for this not only goes to show that they truly want to allow everyone to get their hands on something to write with, but also indicative of what is to come in their line up for the new iPad Pros.</p>
<p>The boycott is over from Brydge, and I couldn&rsquo;t be happier with my decision to buy this product, and if you want to make you iPad Pro equally beautiful and functional, there isn&rsquo;t anything better the Brydge.</p>
