        <h2 itemprop="name headline">Why iPad vs Mac</h2>
    </header>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>I love my iPad, so much so that I created a blog for it. It&rsquo;s clear that I talk a lot about how to use an iPad as a &ldquo;laptop replacement&ldquo;&rdquo; but I never have gone into why I chose to do this.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_398278">To explain this there are two schools of thought, one being why I personally chose this and then the reasons that can be universal to everyone.</p>
<h1 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_398281">Personal Reasons</h1>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_398284"><a href="http://twitter.com/viticci">Federico Viticci</a> really changed how I looked at the iPad and is one of the biggest reasons I picked up my iPad for something other than Netflix and YouTube. It all started with him and his blog <a href="https://www.macstories.net/">MacStories</a> and his story of how while he was battling cancer he found a way to write on his blog with the iPad. This lead to him finding ways to use that device for everything he did. Knowing how someone can turn this big slab of glass into a work horse of a machine-made me really rethink of what you need from a computer, even what a computer actually was.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_398292">From there it was my curiosity and persistence to throw everything I could at these machines to see what stuck and what didn&rsquo;t. To continue with the spaghetti metaphor, I found most of what I threw at the wall stuck.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_398295">I needed a machine that can handle multiple areas of my life: podcasting, writing, and the occasional image editing. All three of these things were handled in some capacity or another, some with less friction, and others with more. No matter the obstacles I had to hurdle there was a solution to allow me to use this tablet as my main machine, and that was easily the hard part of the battle. I was able to store my laptop away from my desk and accomplish everything I wanted with just my iPad Air 2, and now my iPad Pro.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_398298">But my personal reasons are just a portion of why I use the iPad. I also have some more general reasons that I think goes further than just my personal journey.</p>
<h1 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_398301">General Reasons</h1>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_398304">My personal reasons were much more intimate, but for the general reasons I wanted to list them out and just show how many reasons there are for me, and possibly you, to use an iPad over any other computer.</p>
<h2 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_398307">Portability</h2>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_398310">Having the ability to carry a tablet that weighs light enough to hold as a book in my hand-made even my MacBook Air seems cumbersome. The iPad is the epitome of a portable computer and having to take my computer with me to work and other places regularly this meant my bag was getting a lot lighter.</p>
<h2 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_398313">Ease of Use</h2>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_398316">David Sparks of <a href="https://www.macsparky.com/">MacSparky</a> has said before that working on the iPad such a &ldquo;delight.&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t agree more with him in the regard. Something about being able to move things with your fingers directly on-screen is much more satisfying than using a trackpad on any Mac. It felt like the future when I can actually move a piece of text or part of an image with the tips of my fingers.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_398322">There is also something special with the Apple Pencil as an input device. I know there are things you can buy to use a stylus with a computer but The Apple Pencil has no frills or hiccups because it is an Apple product for Apple devices. The Apple Pencil isn&rsquo;t something I use all the time but when I do I am elated to have it. I jot notes down with it, markup PDFs, even just use to fight RSI when I get cramps on my hands. I posted some other reasons to use an Apple Pencil as well if you're considering getting one.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_398328">Battery Life</h2>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_398331">Charging my Macbook was a given when I decided to take it outside my desk, which meant that I also needed to find a place to do my work that had an outlet readily available. Finding a place to work that also has seating at or near an electrical outlet made my goal to find somewhere to work outside my home very undesirable.</p>
<h2 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_398334">iOS Software</h2>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_398337">Development for iOS is on a much more secure foundation than macOS is in my opinion. Buying a Mac App isn&rsquo;t as easy as a one-stop shop that is the iTunes Store. The Mac App Store has had its issues over the past several years and it doesn&rsquo;t look like there is a light at the end of the tunnel just yet.</p>
<h2 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_398340">Ability to Focus</h2>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_398343">One of the big reasons I love the iPad is because it allows me to focus on what matters. With a Mac or PC of any kind it is way too easy to have your writing app next to a YouTube video or search for things and go down a Wikipedia rabbit hole. With only having just one or two apps up and nothing else in the way I can find ways to focus on the things that matter.</p>
<h1 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_398346">Conclusion</h1>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_398349">So there are a plethora of reasons for me to love the iPad, but this is more about why&nbsp;<em>you</em> love the iPad. I hope these reasons helped explain that. If I missed something or you would like to add to this feel free to comment below!</p>
