    <div class="post-content">
        <p>I have long said that the open web is something I feel strongly about, and that in order for you to truly&nbsp;<em>own</em> something on the internet it has to be on your personal website. You can’t expect companies like Twitter, Facebook, Medium, or other big name social media platforms to care about that stuff. They should, but we all know that it is in their best nature to keep that stuff in&nbsp;<em>their</em> home turf and make it as difficult as possible to get it elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To save time, my argument for the open web boils down to this: <strong>Would you rather have all of your work in the hands of someone else, or in your own hands?</strong></p>
<p>I bring this up because Automattic, the company that owns WordPress.com, recently bought Tumblr for <a href="https://www.axios.com/verizon-tumblr-wordpress-automattic-e6645edd-bc73-45c2-9380-9fe8ca34291f.html">a reportedly $3 million steal</a> (don’t forget&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/08/13/tumblr-once-sold-billion-owner-wordpress-just-bought-site-fraction-that/?noredirect=on">Tumblr sold just a few years ago for $1.1 billion</a>). If you want to know <em>why</em> I am excited about this, and why it caused me to think about the open web, I think Aja Romano said it best in <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/8/13/20802751/wordpress-tumblr-sale-porn-ban-future">their Vox article</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>WordPress has succeeded thus far by not rocking the boat, catering to its community, and essentially doing one thing — blogging — extremely well. This would seem to make it an ideal parent for Tumblr’s more unruly, unwieldy blog format, which gave the world the “reblog” and made use of universalized tagging systems to connect its noisy user base. WordPress, with no reblogs, has a much less streamlined tagging system, and its “blogroll” approach to connecting users feels hopelessly outdated. In essence, each company has things to teach the other about blogging.</p>
<p>“I don’t think there’s any organic connection between the two platforms,” Dash told me, “though I do hope Automattic updates WordPress’s feature for reading blogs to be as good as Tumblr’s timeline.”</p>
<p>Where WordPress excels over Tumblr, however, is in respecting and following its community’s lead on things like site design. One of the foundations of its success is <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/">its commitment</a> to open source web design, meaning anyone can make and customize their own WordPress website theme. We might say Tumblr is something of an open source community too, with the ecosystem flourishing and growing most when it’s able to be artistically inventive and essentially bend Tumblr’s format in new and interesting directions. (For instance, the site was initially intended to be a “microblog,” closer in spirit to Twitter’s original 180-character limit; instead, Tumblr users made the platform well-known for long, image-heavy posts, subcultural artistic movements, and animated GIF storytelling.) Tumblr’s corporate overlords have had significant trouble with this notion in the past, but supporting a more hands-off community is not something that should give Automattic much trouble.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For further information on the deal, there's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/14/20804894/tumblr-acquisition-matt-mullenweg-ceo-automattic-wordpress-verizon-changes-vergecast">a recent Vergecast where they interviewed</a> Automattic’s CEO, Matt Mullenweg, I left that podcast wanting to directly support WordPress; so I did. I moved my website from <a href="https://www.easywp.com">EasyWP</a> on NameCheap to WordPress hosting through WordPress.com. To be honest I thought about checking out Tumblr, but as someone who has never tried it, I thought diving in now for my personal site would be overkill.</p>
<p>The cost to move to WordPress.com was a bit more than what I was paying previous (almost double), and the functionality isn’t as flexible as the self-hosted websites are, but with the bad comes a lot of good. For one, I no longer have to worry about my website being optimized properly, and if I have any issues I can contact one of WordPress’ Happiness Engineers (which is a great job title if you ask me) for assistance. So far the response time has been much less than it would have taken services like Squarespace or NameCheap to help me with technical support. The move was simple, thanks to already having a WordPress website, and when I needed clarification it was handled in hours, not days.</p>
<p>I personally feel like this move is better for me in the long run. I get to worry less about making my website “perfect” every 6 weeks and instead start working on what should matter the most: writing; which I hope to do more of going forward.</p>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p><strong>Update</strong>: A couple of people have asked if me not having an iPad means the end of <a href="http://aslabofglass.com">A Slab of Glass</a>, it is not. Christopher and I both have talked about the podcast being more than just about the iPad, and we have been making strides to do that over the past few months. So no, A Slab of Glass isn't going anywhere.</p>
<hr />
<p>After about 2 months of it collecting dust, I decided it was time to say goodbye to my iPad Pro and consequently the iPad Lifestyle. There are a couple of reasons for this, but I will stick with the one that is worth talking about: I simply don't use an iPad anymore for my work.</p>
<p>No, this isn't a "you can't get real work done on an iPad" article. I <em>have</em> gotten real work done on an iPad for years and loved it, but due to some changes in my life the iPad isn't the best tool for the job anymore.</p>
<p>The big one for me is editing and processing audio. I use <a href="https://www.izotope.com/en/products/repair-and-edit/rx.html">iZotope RX 7</a> for cleaning up both of my own podcasts and the podcasts I edit in my freelance work. There isn't a great alternative on iOS that compares to iZotope RX 7, which leaves me to crack open my laptop whenever I need to edit podcasts. Because of this I have moved all of my podcast editing to my MacBook Pro. A lot of my time is spent editing podcasts nowadays it makes little sense to me to move from a MacBook to an iPad for the minority of the work I have left.</p>
<p>If I am being totally honest, it isn't just the editing that makes me want to use my Mac over the iPad. I'm not sure if it is me not always happy with certain limitations on iOS or if I am just used to the Mac, but something about the Mac allows me to work with less friction. I am almost positive this is a mental thing with me and not the limitation of the iPad that is causing this, the MacBook just seems much more appealing to me when I want to get to work on something involving a computer. Whether it's writing, editing podcasts, editing photos, managing email, or simply browsing online, the Mac just fits to me more than the iPad.</p>
<p>I loved my iPad and it wasn't easy for me to come to terms that I simply am not using it, but I needed the extra cash and I would rather sell it than have it collect dust on my desk.</p>
<p>It will be a significant transition to only have an iPhone and MacBook Pro but I think it was still the right choice for me in my life today. Maybe one day I will decide that is no longer the case and move back to the iPad more, but for now it is just me and my MacBook Pro, and I am happy with that.</p>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>It's no secret that I write a lot about blogging on Rocket Panda. I have a thing with going meta, I even used to host a podcast about podcasting before Rocket Panda even existed. That said, sometimes it can be fun to go down memory lane.</p>
<p>Yesterday I was migrating my website over to micro.blog<sup id="fnref-972-1"><a href="#fn-972-1" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup> and I noticed something about my writing style over the last two years. There's been a stark contrast in my older posts and the ones I write now, and I wanted to talk about it.</p>
<p>My older posts were me trying to imitate and mimic tech journalists like that of 9to5Mac and TechCrunch. I was trying to be more journalistic and matter-of-fact without adding anything personal to them. I even tried to make myself sound like and Apple expert, but if I am being honest with myself I know little about the history of Apple and the impact they made before 2008, which was when I jumped into the Apple ecosystem.</p>
<p>Once I realized that wasn't working out for me, I moved to doing things like listicles and have my <a href="https://jeffperry.blog/2018/02/05/ipad-life-hacks.html">Top 10 iPad Life Hacks</a> and <a href="https://jeffperry.blog/2018/04/10/the-things-i.html">The 9 Things I Learned Going iPad Only</a>. I look back at both of these kinds of writing and cringe, because desperation has a foul and pungent scent and I reeked of it. After I got over how much of a try-hard I must have looked like I realized that had I not done those things and looked in the mirror afterwards I wouldn't have come to the conclusion I have today about what it is I want to write about the things that I'm passionate about.</p>
<p>If you look at my more recent pieces, I am writing more personal pieces about the things that I can add personal input on. I have written things like <a href="https://www.jeffperry.blog/2019/06/06/why-ios-made.html">Why iOS 13 Made the iPad Home Screen Fun Again</a> and my <a href="https://www.jeffperry.blog/2019/05/08/touchtype-pro-review.html">TouchType Pro Review</a><sup id="fnref-972-2"><a href="#fn-972-2" class="jetpack-footnote">2</a></sup>. These things are comments on the news from Apple and the companies that cater to those users, but I center it on myself and my feelings on it instead of trying to make this an article for TechCrunch or something similar.</p>
<p>It is much more satisfying for me to comment on the smaller things that I'm comfortable speaking on instead of trying to get my share of the pie with what the rest of the big Apple blogs are commenting on. There are times where I may add my feelings and opinions on something but only when it is something that I am comfortable with. Gone are the days where I try and do some quick research and reading up on something that I know <em>nothing</em> about just so that I can be with the rest of the Apple News cycle. It is great if you enjoy that but I found it to be extraordinarily draining both mentally and emotionally. Chasing that forever-spinning wheel of tech news is not something for me.</p>
<p>If I am still staying honest, it's hard to make a blog about the Apple news as a single independent writer. That faucet is broken and it is just a firehose of information shooting out at you with an unlimited supply of water. I have tried being a part of the firehose and it's simply not for me. I would rather be a trickle of water by myself for a small amount of people to drink from. Which brings me to why I have moved my site to <a href="http://micro.blog">micro.blog</a>.</p>
<h2>Why I Moved to Micro.blog <sup id="fnref-972-4"><a href="#fn-972-4" class="jetpack-footnote">3</a></sup></h2>
<p>The reason for this is two-fold:</p>
<ol>
<li>I am not a Pro Blogger, and I need to stop acting like one</li>
<li>The atmosphere at micro.blog isn't as formal as something like WordPress for me, and I like that</li>
</ol>
<p>When I say I am not a Pro Blogger I mean that I don't have hundreds of thousands of readers, and I don't think I necessarily want that. It isn't a goal in my life to make Rocket Panda anything other than a way for me to express myself creatively. I don't look at stats, I don't see what posts are getting the most clicks, and I definitely don't want to make my site a digital billboard with ads everywhere and videos playing automatically. That wasn't the case when I first started though, I wanted to make Rocket Panda my full time job so badly. So much so I was willing to throw a piece together I thought would get lots of clicks and subscribers instead of writing something that I was happy with.</p>
<p>What I want when it comes to this blog is that I own every pixel top to bottom and that I can say what I want, when I want without worrying about upsetting anyone that has control over my livelihood.</p>
<p>As for the second point, micro.blog is a place for me I consider a much friendlier atmosphere than that of Twitter or Instagram. There's nothing about this service that makes me upset or feel inadequate about myself. It is just writers and bloggers sharing their lives, thoughts, ideas, and photos with others. As someone that doesn't have a staff of writers it can be lonely at times writing, and having the ability to be a part of a community that isn't culturally toxic and genuinely delightful helps fill that void for me.</p>
<p>I could have kept my blog on WordPress and linked it to micro.blog, but for me it made more sense to just put all of my chips in this service and embrace the limitations it comes with. I am happy with my setup and I hope to see it stick, and I think that this time it will.</p>
<p>After some tinkering and playing around I finally figure out how to fix my biggest gripe with the service, which was differentiating the micro posts (the things I would post on Twitter) to the articles (like this one). Because of the addition to categories and the support for Hugo I managed to figure out how to add parameters to my site to hide my micro posts from the website but still have them post to micro.blog for those who follow me there. For those interested, I found the answer to that from <a href="https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/only-show-posts-not-in-a-given-category/17655/3">the Hugo Discourse</a> which is a group of helpful individuals<sup id="fnref-972-3"><a href="#fn-972-3" class="jetpack-footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This isn't me saying that you should move to micro.blog, that is for you to decide. That said, I do think that more bloggers should look I the mirror and answer the tough questions about what they are writing about and what they want to share, because it took me <em>way</em> longer than it should have to listen to the people who told me to write more personal posts over the bland lists and news articles I was writing.</p>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>Something about this video makes me realize the <em>real</em> reason I am blogging on Rocket Panda instead of something like SquareSpace or Tumblr. It isn't because I think WordPress is a better platform, that is debatable on many different levels. The reason is because it’s <em>my</em> platform. I own every pixel of this website and I can control what goes on here and what doesn't.</p>
<p>This isn't about WordPress though, it is about the open web. If you are unsure what the open web is, I will let Mark Surman, Executive Director of the <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/">Mozilla Foundation</a>, explain.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.yearofopen.org/november-open-perspective-what-is-open-web/what-is-the-open-web-and-why-is-it-important-submitted-by-mark-surman-executive-director-of-the-mozilla-foundation/">Mark Surman writing on Year of Open</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <strong>What is Open Web?</strong></p>
<p>  “Open web” is a sweeping term — it encompasses technical concepts like open-source code and open standards. It also encompasses democratic concepts like free expression and digital inclusion.</p>
<p>  But there’s a single underlying principle connecting all these ideas: An open web is a web by and for all its users, not select gatekeepers or governments.</p>
<p>  At Mozilla, we compare the open web to a global public resource, like clean water or the environment. The open web is something we all depend on: to communicate and create, to work and play, to buy and sell. And like any other natural resource, it’s fragile. It needs care, because it can be polluted: by harassment and abuse, by misinformation, by bad public policy.</p>
<p>  <strong>Why is it important?</strong></p>
<p>  The web doesn’t exist in a vacuum, or apart from society. The two are deeply entwined. The web is where we engage with journalism, form opinions and share knowledge. It’s an arena for politics, education, culture and science.</p>
<p>  An open web means positive progress for all these things. A more informed public; more civic participation; more opportunities to learn and connect with each other.</p>
<p>  An unhealthy web has an opposite effect. When misinformation, harassment or surveillance proliferate online, we lose trust in our institutions and in each other. Fewer people engage. And when closed, proprietary technology proliferates, innovation and competition are stifled. The web is no longer a level playing field — it’s a platform controlled by a select few.
</p></blockquote>
<p>While the main issue is governments seeking control of the internet, another entity is at work to wall up our content and lives: social media. I read somewhere a long time ago that you can't be playing in someone else's yard and then get upset when they kick you off it.</p>
<p>If Facebook one day decides that they want to close up shop all of the photos, posts, videos, status updates, and events you have put there are susceptible of going away forever. While losing a large part of your digital life can be catastrophic the thing that I think is much more dangerous is the freedoms you are giving up as a cost of entry into Facebook and Twitter and Instagram.</p>
<p>These social media giants aren't making these social networks just so you can stay in touch with friends and family, it is to get data and demographic information for marketing and advertisers. You are the product, and the more information these companies can get on you the better.</p>
<p>That said, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/sign-in-with-apple/">Apple is planning to launch Sign In with Apple</a> soon and that is a game changer in my opinion. You no longer have to use your personal information to log in to a service. You can now use great services online and in the App Store <em>without</em> having to worry about privacy concerns. This is the digital version of having your cake and eating it too.</p>
<p>I plan to remove every piece of my Facebook the moment I get married this summer. I no longer want to be a part of a company I deem to be evil, and I don’t want to keep feeding them my personal data for a myriad of reasons.</p>
<p>I guess what I am trying to say is when I want to share something on the internet I am going to do it on Rocket Panda, and I hope that you consider doing the same for your stuff.</p>

    </header>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>I have been thinking a lot about habits lately and I think that one of my biggest flaws, as many others also have, is that we suffer from 3 Stooges Syndrome.</p>
<p>One thing, I constantly deal with is new interests and goals I set for myself when I want to make a positive change in my life. The issue is when I have so many things that it all seems to be too much.</p>
<p>I can’t lose weight, eat healthier, plan my mornings, read more, learn something new everyday, save more money, <em>and</em> do one nice thing a day all the time.</p>
<p>One thing I have learned over the years about myself is that I plan and set all of these things I want to accomplish and hit the ground running with every single one of them simultaneously.</p>
<p>Doing this seems plausible and honestly really exciting when I get started. But by day 5 I’m questioning whether I <em>really</em> need to go to the gym again, or I tell myself I am “too busy” writing a blog post to make a healthy lunch so I get McDonald’s <em>again</em>. “It’s fine,” I say to myself shoveling fries in my face, “I can afford <em>one</em> bad meal this week.” I am sure I am not the only one. You have probably done something similar, right?</p>
<p>I’d like to take a page out of The Simpsons when I talk about these kinds of things, and call it the 3 Stooges Syndrome.</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/aI0euMFAWF8</p>
<p>As you can see in the video, Mr. Burns is in for a doctors exam. Turns out he has <em>so many</em> illnesses his immune system won’t let any of them through the door because they are all prevent the other from getting in (cue noises from Curly).</p>
<p>If we dissect this a bit and spin it to make these illnesses into goals and resolutions you make foryourself, it’s obvious that having all of these grand plans you set means nothing was going to get through that door.</p>
<p>I’m not saying goals and resolutions are illnesses, but I am saying that if you have too many you won’t be able to accomplish any of them. So what do you do?</p>
<p>For me, I had close to 10 different things I wanted to accomplish this year and I have slogged through them making zero progress on them. I wrote out all of these things on a piece of paper and really took a hard look at them. I asked myself why I want to accomplish this, what the outcome I wanted was, and what it will take to make this happen. I took an honest look at all of these things and then took an honest look at myself. What could I truly make happen this year? How many of these could I <em>really</em> get done? The answers for these questions made me look at these goals, resolutions, and plans and consider which are worth doing now and which are worth doing later. I decided I am going to do just one of these at a time, and move on to the next one after completing the first.</p>
<p>If I can get just one of these goals accomplished that’s still more than the 10 that were stuck in the proverbial door. One success is better that ten failures.</p>
<p>So if you are like me, and you can’t seem to make much progress on any of the myriad of goals you set yourself, take a long hard look at what you actually want to accomplish and keep the rest in your pocket until you get that first thing done.</p>

  Something changed for me in the last year with my writing and based on feedback I’m getting it’s for the better. When I started blogging back in 2008 I stuck to a niche (at the time it was guitars) then I moved into technology a little while later based off the back of my freelance stuff.</p>
<p>  What I’ve found though in the last year is that I’m writing more personal (posts like this one) and not worrying about sticking to any sort of niche, just writing about what I’m passionate about or is on my mind.

<p></p>
<blockquote><p>
  I guess what I’m trying to say as I’m starting to ramble is if you have a personal blog just BE YOU. Write about your passions be it the latest gadget you love or the most recent movie you’ve enjoyed.
</p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Like so many things Lee writes, this post spoke to me at my core. Recently, <a href="https://twitter.com/iamjeffperry/status/1119755487417913345?s=21">I spent time on Twitter</a> contemplating the name of my site. While doing so, I forgot that the name of my site doesn't matter if I don't know what I want to say on it.</p>
<p>My answer to that is this, Rocket Panda was created because I wanted to have a name outside the box Tablet Habit was putting me in, and I have slowly done so. I plan to continue to do so, and write about the things I want to write and not worry about my "niche" as much.</p>

    </header>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>I realized after talking with <a href="http://gr36.com">Greg Morris</a> for his podcast <em>And You Are?</em> that I am someone that is <strong>really good</strong> at getting an idea ready to launch, but pitiful at longevity. I can create a decent website, a logo, and come up with branding ideas for a new project. That said, the moment I make this project public for all to see and get this proverbial plane off the ground I'm lost.</p>
<p>It is why I've changed the look of my website so much or moved my domain over. Everything is because I have this plane up in the air, but now I have no clue what to do next. So instead of pushing myself to learn more and keep moving forward I decide to crash the plane into the ground and start over. I repeatedly lift off again and again because I know I am good at that, it's the unknown that scares me into taking the plane any further.</p>
<p>The same goes for other things in my life, like video games. I have created 6 different players on NBA2K19 all of which I have played at most 4 hours on in total. I create a character, get it set up and play a few games with them but I eventually just want to go back and make new players and try new ways to improve the creation of them. My intention quickly deviates from playing with the character I just created to creating the "best" character I can.</p>
<p>It's maddening to a lot of people who see that I haven't found one thing to focus on. I have lots of little things I work on simultaneously. It reminds me of something I saw recently from the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Essentialism-Disciplined-Pursuit-Greg-McKeown/dp/0804137382"><em>Essentialism</em></a> by Greg McKeown. What I saw was a diagram like this one, except instead of it being Focus it was energy. For me, focus makes more sense.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/bbf8e-focus-chart.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>To sum this up, on the left side of this diagram of my focus with a lot of different things I am working on simultaneously. The arrows indicate how far I get into each one of them. I only have so much focus to give and if I spend all of it on lots of different things I won't get very far in them. On the right side is a different story. I focused on <em>one thing</em> and got much further than I did compared to the image on the left. When I saw this diagram for the first time it was one of those things that just clicked in my brain and never let go.</p>
<p>I have always been someone that does the left side of this image. I get an idea, then another idea, and then another. I decide that none of these great ideas are worth keeping in my pocket for later and I just start doing them all at once. Eventually, after some time has passed, I have gotten little done on all of these different projects. Whereas if I had decided to do one at a time I would have completed them all faster and I would have given each project the focus it deserves to be better.</p>
<h2>My Solution</h2>
<p>I am trying to be more mindful of this diagram and making it something that I consciously make a habit. Here are a few things I am doing to make that happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>I pick one thing to work on at a time as opposed to many. No new projects are started until I finish the one in progress</li>
<li>I am keeping all of my ideas on a separate area in Drafts for later</li>
<li>I am setting deadlines for myself to help keep pressure on the things I am working on, which in turn helps me finish things faster so I can work on something new before I get burned out</li>
<li>I have made this diagram my new home screen</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/assets/f15ca-focus-image-home-screen.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>As someone that is a habitual offender of starting something but never finishing them I am excited to cross the metaphorical finish line more often. I am sure I will have more to say after a little while with this, but for now I am excited to make my work more intentional and less chaotic.</p>

        <h2 itemprop="name headline"><a href="http://localhost:4000/2019/04/17/my-home-screen/">My iPad Pro Home Screen</a></h2>
    </header>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>Since I got a new 2018 12.9" iPad Pro I thought now would be a good time to share my home screen for the iPad. Without burying the lede here is my home screen.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/45540-home-screen-ipad-pro-12-2019-.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>For those wondering, I made the <a href="https://jeffperry449292924.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/ba6b6-show-up-everyday-desktop.png">home screen image</a> myself using <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pixelmator/id924695435?mt=8">Pixelmator</a>.</p>
<p>As you can see there is nothing on the home screen itself, everything lives in the Dock. My reasoning for this is that because the iPad is something that I fluidly move in between apps I rarely actually move to the home screen. There are a handful of apps on the Dock and everything that isn't readily accessible goes into a folder that I have organized where each page of the folder goes from most important apps to least important apps. So for my first page I have things like Google Sheets and Google Docs where a lot of the things I do for both my personal life and podcasts live. I also have apps like 1Password, Tweetbot, WordPress, and Ferrite which are apps I regularly use but aren't something I need immediately accessible.</p>
<p>The apps that did make it on my Dock are ones that I use every day and oftentimes within Split View. I have them in order of left to right from most used to least used. The reasoning for this is that because of the fluidity of the Recent Apps section of the Dock if I were to have the apps I use most frequently in the middle of the dock it can shift several icons left or right from when I last used it. Which is problematic for when I have a blog post idea or a task I need to throw in Drafts 5 before I forget it.</p>
<p>Here's a quick synopsis of each of those apps.</p>
<h2>Drafts</h2>
<p>Drafts has quickly become my main text editor for pretty much everything in my life. From tasks, lists, blog post ideas, full fledged posts I am working on, and even just something I need to keepsake for a few minutes before I can toss it in the trash. Drafts has always had the tag line of "where text starts" and that is what Drafts has become for me.</p>
<h2>Fiery Feeds</h2>
<p>This has been my RSS reader of choice for some time now and continues to be the app I use most when reading stuff. With FeedWrangler as my RSS service of choice I look at the dozens of blogs, sites, news organizations new items all in one place. the sharing features it offers also satisfies my needs with Instapaper integration as well as Pinboard.</p>
<h2>GoodTask</h2>
<p>I have been battling finding a task manager that checks every box I want. So instead I decided to pick something that I haven't given a fair shake, which is GoodTask. I will probably be talking a lot more about this later, but for now it is getting the job done. It is also very Shortcuts friendly and has some decent Drafts 5 support thanks to Reminders being the foundation of this app.</p>
<h2>Instapaper</h2>
<p>I have been using Instapaper for a while now and it continues to be my favorite read-later service. It has great keyboard shortcuts and allows for folders to organize the various kinds of things I save to read later. Also, the Share Sheet is a treat to use anywhere I want to save an article or even just a link to the article.</p>
<h2>Fantastical</h2>
<p>Hands down the best calendar app for iOS, and arguable macOS. The natural language support makes adding tasks and reminders a breeze. I also have always been a fan of its look.</p>
<h2>AirMail</h2>
<p>This is the most recent addition to my Dock, thanks to its sharing actions I can send my actionable emails to Reminders which syncs with GoodTask for future me to deal with.</p>
<h2>Messages</h2>
<p>This is simply the way I communicate with nearly everyone in my life. There is a reason Messages is the most use app in iOS globally.</p>
<h2>Safari</h2>
<p>Safari is the browser I use 90% of the time. The other 10% is for iCab Mobile, which allows me to download files, view websites in desktops mode, and do things that Safari for iOS limits me on. For me iCab is a safety net for web browsing while Safari is my go-to app for anything involving a hyperlink.</p>
<h2>Shortcuts</h2>
<p>I almost left this one in the folder, but I have been making more and more Shortcuts lately and having it available in the Dock makes things a lot smoother for when I have an idea for something I need to automate.</p>
<h2>Files</h2>
<p>Simply put, I need access to my files and I don't want to spend time looking for the Files app in a folder or bringing it up in Spotlight every time I need it. It isn't perfect but it works for me when I need to save something or grab an item in my Dropbox and/or iCloud Drive.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>My home screen may not be anything to write home about, but it is something that sets precedent of what is important for me when I am using the iPad. Hopefully my home screen inspires you to think about how you organize your apps and make any changes you deem necessary to make you happier.</p>
<p>If you want to share your home screen with me feel free to <a href="mailto:jeff@rocketpanda.net">email me</a> or send me a photo of your home screen <a href="https://twitter.com/iamjeffperry">on Twitter</a>.</p>

    </header>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>I recently took <a href="https://thesweetsetup.com/ulysses/?utm_source=hello_bar">a course</a> by <a href="https://shawnblanc.net">Shawn Blanc</a> about <a href="http://ulysses.app">Ulysses</a> and learned <em>a ton</em> about the premium writing application, but one thing that I loved just as much were the extra emails Shawn sent out after I purchased the course.</p>
<p>My main takeaways from the emails he sent were these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t overthink things</li>
<li>Make the time to write</li>
<li>Give yourself permission to be crappy</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these things are useful for someone like me who writes for fun and as a hobby on Rocket Panda. Honestly its just plain good advice for anyone doing something creative whether it is for a job or a hobby. I frequently look at these pieces of advice Shawn expressed and it makes me think about the one thing that I want to do more of as a blogger: <strong>consistency</strong>.</p>
<p>These four pieces of advice are perfectly in sync with my main issues in posting more frequently and making writing a daily habit for myself.</p>
<h2>Don’t Overthink Things</h2>
<p>One of the biggest reasons I’m not writing and posting consistently is because when I begin writing a post I make sure it is <em>absolutely perfect</em> and I overthink the point of why I am writing on Rocket Panda in the first place.</p>
<p>I created Rocket Panda because I wanted to share ideas, thoughts, and interesting things with like-minded people. People who love technology, automation, Apple, and other geeky things. I never got into this “blogging scene” to become rich and famous, I did it because I wanted a way to eexpress my love and interests with others.</p>
<p>There is <a href="https://youtu.be/krK4YJgYPGc">a great video by Sean McCabe</a> that is all about overthinking things and how creative people should stop doing it.</p>
<p>At first I thought this is something that’s easier said than done. After all, Sean has a successful business and podcast and I feel like I have hit a wall when it comes to growth in readers for Rocket Panda. After some time feeling sorry for myself, I realized that this goes in tandem with posting frequently and showing up every day to make those consistent posts happen. I know that the idea of “if you build it they will come” isn’t something that is always true, but it doesn't hurt to hit deadlines and make posting something you have in a calendar. If I say I will have a post live on a specific day I am more likely to post it rather than hitting publish after weeks of spending meticulous time making sure everything is <em>absolutely perfect</em>.</p>
<p>So instead of making things “perfect” I plan to make frequency and deadlines be my determining factor of when to publish. If the clock is racing and I don’t feel good about something I’m writing I am more likely to improve it <em>and still</em> hit my deadline in the process.</p>
<h2>Make the Time to Write</h2>
<p>When it comes to any craft you want to get better at, you have to make it something you do regularly. If you don’t then you’ll never improve in any significant way. This isn’t anything new for me but it is something I am reminding myself when it comes to writing. Which is why my goal every day is to write 500 crappy words at a minimum.</p>
<p>If I want to hit that goal of 500 words a day, I need to show up every day to write, and right now it just isn’t happening.</p>
<p>The thing that helped me with this valley of nothing was <a href="https://youtu.be/GExHiI_bQqc">Merlin Mann’s talk at MacWorld in 2009 about the patterns for creativity</a>. I have this video starting at 18:15 because this is where the nut of what got me started. The only thing you really need to know is that there is a book called <em>Creative Habit</em> by Twyla Tharp and when she is asked to do a project she uses these boxes where she does this thing called “scratching” which is her putting literally anything and everything that brings her inspiration. I recommend watching the whole thing to fully understand things but that is the very brief version of what led to this 5 minute section of the talk.</p>
<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GExHiI_bQqc&amp;t=18m15s</p>
<p>There’s a lot to unpack in this talk, and maybe I will write more about it someday, but this got me thinking about why I haven’t been making the time to write. It was because I didn't want it enough.</p>
<p>This isn’t me saying you have to go all-in and work 18 hour days to make your dreams come true, but it is me saying that I spent more time trying to find inspiration from writers and bloggers who were at the level I wanted to be at. I was gawking at their work online wishing I was where they were instead of making the stuff I wanted to make. That isn't their fault though, it’s mine. I cared more about the idea of blogging and writing than actually putting in the work and making a commitment to myself to keep working on the things I want to be better at.</p>
<h2>Give Yourself Permission to be Crappy</h2>
<p>I am not as strong a writer as I would like to be, but if I allow that distance between where I am and where I want to be affect me then I would never write again. The only way that you can get better at a craft is to keep doing it over and over again and learn from your mistakes.</p>
<p>I think it’s been made painfully clear that I am a perfectionist and I never allowed myself to just be okay with mediocrity, let alone being crappy. Still, I think if I allow myself to write 500 crappy words a day I will get better faster than if I wrote 1000 good words every few weeks.</p>
<p>Being perfect is overrated in my opinion. I say that knowing full well that has been what I’ve been striving for the last year writing on my blog. Honestly it’s just exhausting reading over your work a dozen times and making small and unnecessary edits. That said, there is a difference between being perfect and having something presentable.</p>
<p>This isn’t me saying that I will be drafting something up without proofreading and multiple edits. I still plan to do the work of combing through for errors and mispellings. The part I <em>won’t</em> be doing is going through what I have written actively looking for something to change just to change it. I want to <a href="https://jeffperry.blog/2019/04/keeping-it-simple/">keep things simple</a>.</p>
<h2>Changes for Rocket Panda</h2>
<p>All of this has come to a head for me and there are some changes effective today that will be taking place at Rocket Panda.</p>
<h3>1. I Will Write at Least 30 Minutes Every Day</h3>
<p>Now, 30 minutes doesn’t sound like a lot, but with that low bar of entry I have no excuse for myself to make the time to write every single day for 30 minutes. I have found if I spend that amount of time writing I am able to shake the cobwebs off and really start diving into more focused writing.</p>
<h3>2. I Will Post <em>at Least</em> Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday</h3>
<p>I will make a total of 3 posts a week on Rocket Panda. I may post more, but I am committing to 3. They might just be links to things I find interesting or longer articles that I spend lots of time writing. Either way I have set the precedent that I am posting on specific days and that this is my new posting schedule.</p>
<p>If I’m being honest, this is a safe space after all, I wanted to commit to more than 3 posts a week. I wanted to go daily but I know that the one day I miss posting I will kick myself for it and lose all sense of control. I have been there before and I stopped writing for weeks because I was too busy beating myself up for not meeting the exceedingly high bar I set myself. I want to avoid that this time so I have lowered the bar for myself and will start out with 3 posts a week and see where things take me afterwards.</p>
<p>The first post of the week starts today with this one. The next scheduled post will be Wednesday.</p>
<h2>One More Thing</h2>
<p>One of the biggest things that I want to stress and put out there for both you and me is that it is okay to not think that what you are putting out there is perfect. Perfection is what stifles my creativity and my writing process every single time I let it take precedent. I can’t move on to the next post until I make it published, and I won’t publish unless it is perfect. <strong>Screw being perfect</strong>, if I look back on my work and think I could have said it better that only means that I am improving on my craft.</p>
<p>So with these new promises I hope to achieve the goal I have wanted for a while and post consistently and create without overthinking things. If I can do that this year I would consider it a success.</p>

    </header>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>This week for me has been all too familiar, meaning I moved my site from micro.blog to Wordpress <em>again</em>.</p>
<p>The reasoning for this doesn’t really even matter anymore because I have done nothing for the past several months but screw around with where my site is hosted instead of doing what matters <strong>writing</strong>. After hours of editing my new WordPress website, talking with support, and waiting for DNS changes to propagate I have finally managed to have Rocket Panda back up and running.</p>
<p>I have mentioned it in the past, but I think one of the reasons I do this is because I treat my blog like a Lego collection instead of a platform. I try to make sure every block is perfectly put together instead of making sure that what I’m building is even worthwhile.</p>
<p>I also feel like it is a form of procrastination. I would ask myself questions like, “How can I make time for writing on my site? I have so much I need to do to make Rocket Panda look better.”</p>
<p><strong>Today that changes.</strong></p>
<p>As of today I have made a promise to myself to stick it out on WordPress and use a seriously simple theme called <a href="http://mtomas.com/1/">Tiny Framework</a>. It is a simple yet effective theme that meets my simple blogging needs. It also allows for fast loading and processing. You add that to <a href="https://www.easywp.com/">EasyWP</a>, my hosting platform, and you have yourself a cheap and fast website that doesn’t need anything else.</p>
<p>I have made the commitment to myself, and now with you all publicly, to not make any more changes to the hosting platform, theme, or aesthetics for the rest of 2019. The only exemption from this is if something is catastrophic to the website and requires me to make changes to it in order for it to be fully functional. Outside of that what you see is what you get. What you see may not be deserving of any design awards, but you can at least read what I have to say easily and not have any issues loading the site.</p>
<p>My reasoning for this commitment, and really a lot of things I get hung up about, is to stop worrying about the granular details and just keep things simple. I also needed to take stock in what was important for me on Rocket Panda, and for me it is the content. I would rather have a website that looks like it was built with a default template on Blogger in 2004 with tons of posts than have the most beautiful website with no content to show for it. So I am choosing to keep this less-then-beautiful website as-is and focus on what I want to say on it instead.</p>
<p>With this off my chest and the burden of making my website “look perfect” gone I can finally get back to what I made Rocket Panda for in the first place: to share my thoughts, opinions, and anecdotes about the things I care about.</p>
