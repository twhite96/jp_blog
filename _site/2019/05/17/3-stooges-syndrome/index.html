    </header>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>I have been thinking a lot about habits lately and I think that one of my biggest flaws, as many others also have, is that we suffer from 3 Stooges Syndrome.</p>
<p>One thing, I constantly deal with is new interests and goals I set for myself when I want to make a positive change in my life. The issue is when I have so many things that it all seems to be too much.</p>
<p>I can’t lose weight, eat healthier, plan my mornings, read more, learn something new everyday, save more money, <em>and</em> do one nice thing a day all the time.</p>
<p>One thing I have learned over the years about myself is that I plan and set all of these things I want to accomplish and hit the ground running with every single one of them simultaneously.</p>
<p>Doing this seems plausible and honestly really exciting when I get started. But by day 5 I’m questioning whether I <em>really</em> need to go to the gym again, or I tell myself I am “too busy” writing a blog post to make a healthy lunch so I get McDonald’s <em>again</em>. “It’s fine,” I say to myself shoveling fries in my face, “I can afford <em>one</em> bad meal this week.” I am sure I am not the only one. You have probably done something similar, right?</p>
<p>I’d like to take a page out of The Simpsons when I talk about these kinds of things, and call it the 3 Stooges Syndrome.</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/aI0euMFAWF8</p>
<p>As you can see in the video, Mr. Burns is in for a doctors exam. Turns out he has <em>so many</em> illnesses his immune system won’t let any of them through the door because they are all prevent the other from getting in (cue noises from Curly).</p>
<p>If we dissect this a bit and spin it to make these illnesses into goals and resolutions you make foryourself, it’s obvious that having all of these grand plans you set means nothing was going to get through that door.</p>
<p>I’m not saying goals and resolutions are illnesses, but I am saying that if you have too many you won’t be able to accomplish any of them. So what do you do?</p>
<p>For me, I had close to 10 different things I wanted to accomplish this year and I have slogged through them making zero progress on them. I wrote out all of these things on a piece of paper and really took a hard look at them. I asked myself why I want to accomplish this, what the outcome I wanted was, and what it will take to make this happen. I took an honest look at all of these things and then took an honest look at myself. What could I truly make happen this year? How many of these could I <em>really</em> get done? The answers for these questions made me look at these goals, resolutions, and plans and consider which are worth doing now and which are worth doing later. I decided I am going to do just one of these at a time, and move on to the next one after completing the first.</p>
<p>If I can get just one of these goals accomplished that’s still more than the 10 that were stuck in the proverbial door. One success is better that ten failures.</p>
<p>So if you are like me, and you can’t seem to make much progress on any of the myriad of goals you set yourself, take a long hard look at what you actually want to accomplish and keep the rest in your pocket until you get that first thing done.</p>
