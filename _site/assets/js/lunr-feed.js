      title: "MarsEdit Custom Formatting Macros",

      content: "I have been only using my Mac for a little while now, and one thing that I love about the Mac is MarsEdit. This is by far my favorite app when it comes to blogging. It is dead easy to setup, and you have full control on your posts and pages without needing to use the WordPress web app. You can make pages, local drafts, and of course blog posts for your site all within MarsEdit.\nOne thing I didn’t realize about MarsEdit until I saw it in a recent release notes page is custom macros for formatting.\nBasically this allows you to edit the key bindings on MarsEdit for a number of built in formatting shortcuts. For example, MarsEdit ships with the Paste Link shortcut being Shift+⌘+A. As someone who is used to Ulysses and the WordPress web app I changed that shortcut to be ⌘+K instead. It is second nature for me to make that my link shortcut, and I love being able to change in MarsEdit.\nNot only can you change baked in formatting macros, you can also make custom formatting shortcuts. To explain, let me show you how I manage my link posts introduction.\nMy link posts contain a very specific format that has come to be a standard among us Apple and Tech link bloggers which is:\nAUTHOR writing for PUBLICATION:\nAll of the above is then linked to the specific URL of the post in question.\nTo do this you first need to right click within the draft and select “Format” and then go all the way down to the bottom of the sub-list and select “Customize...\"\n\nOnce there you will see all of the formatting options that are setup, including the \"Link…” and “Paste Link” options I changed the shortcuts to. But for this example we want to make a new shortcut and we are going to do so by clicking the “+” button on the bottom left.\n\nFrom there you will see something like the image below, asking you for a title, shortcut, Opening Markup (what the format starts with) and a Closing Markup (what it ends with). What you see below might seem daunting, but I assure you it isn’t as hard as it looks. For one thing, there is a very cool tool in the where you can insert placeholders (see below).\nSo if you want to be prompted for text you can select “Ask for text” or if you want the URL you have in your clipboard to automatically be added, you can select “Paste URL.” In the case of this shortcut, I ask for the Author and the Publication, and with the formatting of HTML inserted within it, it takes those two inputs and the URL I have copied in my clipboard and spits out an HTML version of my link post introduction.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best part? If you are like me and write with the WYSIWYG editor instead of the HTML editor it is automatically formatted properly. It is smart enough to know that you are writing in rich text and so it pastes it as such.\nIf you would like the specific code I used for my opening and closing you can copy it below.\nOpening Markup:\n&lt;a href=\"#pasteurl#\"&gt;#asktext author: Jeff Perry# writing for #asktext Publication#\nClosing Markup:\n&lt;/a&gt;:\nOpening Markup from Video:\n#asktext author: Jeff Perry# writing for &lt;a href=\"#pasteurl#\"&gt;#asktext Publication#\nFinally, I created a quick tutorial on how to use this custom shortcut. In it I mention a very cool tool call Karabiner, which allows you to really dive into custom keyboard shortcuts. The most common one is a “hyper key” which transforms the Caps Lock key from making text all caps into a tool that effectively presses Shift+Command+Option+Control all in one go. It is great for when you want to use a custom keyboard shortcut but don’t want to worry about stepping on another keyboard shortcut’s toes. To do that, just download Karabiner and add the following rule under the \"Complex Modifications\" tab:\n\nAnyway, here’s the video:\n\n",

      title: "Moving to WordPress.com",
      category: null,
      content: "I have long said that the open web is something I feel strongly about, and that in order for you to truly&nbsp;own something on the internet it has to be on your personal website. You can’t expect companies like Twitter, Facebook, Medium, or other big name social media platforms to care about that stuff. They should, but we all know that it is in their best nature to keep that stuff in&nbsp;their home turf and make it as difficult as possible to get it elsewhere.&nbsp;\nTo save time, my argument for the open web boils down to this: Would you rather have all of your work in the hands of someone else, or in your own hands?\nI bring this up because Automattic, the company that owns WordPress.com, recently bought Tumblr for a reportedly $3 million steal (don’t forget&nbsp;Tumblr sold just a few years ago for $1.1 billion). If you want to know why I am excited about this, and why it caused me to think about the open web, I think Aja Romano said it best in their Vox article:\nWordPress has succeeded thus far by not rocking the boat, catering to its community, and essentially doing one thing — blogging — extremely well. This would seem to make it an ideal parent for Tumblr’s more unruly, unwieldy blog format, which gave the world the “reblog” and made use of universalized tagging systems to connect its noisy user base. WordPress, with no reblogs, has a much less streamlined tagging system, and its “blogroll” approach to connecting users feels hopelessly outdated. In essence, each company has things to teach the other about blogging.\n“I don’t think there’s any organic connection between the two platforms,” Dash told me, “though I do hope Automattic updates WordPress’s feature for reading blogs to be as good as Tumblr’s timeline.”\nWhere WordPress excels over Tumblr, however, is in respecting and following its community’s lead on things like site design. One of the foundations of its success is its commitment to open source web design, meaning anyone can make and customize their own WordPress website theme. We might say Tumblr is something of an open source community too, with the ecosystem flourishing and growing most when it’s able to be artistically inventive and essentially bend Tumblr’s format in new and interesting directions. (For instance, the site was initially intended to be a “microblog,” closer in spirit to Twitter’s original 180-character limit; instead, Tumblr users made the platform well-known for long, image-heavy posts, subcultural artistic movements, and animated GIF storytelling.) Tumblr’s corporate overlords have had significant trouble with this notion in the past, but supporting a more hands-off community is not something that should give Automattic much trouble.\n\nFor further information on the deal, there's&nbsp;a recent Vergecast where they interviewed Automattic’s CEO, Matt Mullenweg, I left that podcast wanting to directly support WordPress; so I did. I moved my website from EasyWP on NameCheap to WordPress hosting through WordPress.com. To be honest I thought about checking out Tumblr, but as someone who has never tried it, I thought diving in now for my personal site would be overkill.\nThe cost to move to WordPress.com was a bit more than what I was paying previous (almost double), and the functionality isn’t as flexible as the self-hosted websites are, but with the bad comes a lot of good. For one, I no longer have to worry about my website being optimized properly, and if I have any issues I can contact one of WordPress’ Happiness Engineers (which is a great job title if you ask me) for assistance. So far the response time has been much less than it would have taken services like Squarespace or NameCheap to help me with technical support. The move was simple, thanks to already having a WordPress website, and when I needed clarification it was handled in hours, not days.\nI personally feel like this move is better for me in the long run. I get to worry less about making my website “perfect” every 6 weeks and instead start working on what should matter the most: writing; which I hope to do more of going forward.\n",

      content: "Andy Nicolaides writing for The Dent:\nOne of the big questions I asked myself before moving my blog from Wordpress to Micro.Blog recently was ‘what would I call it?’ The name The Dent was kindly offered up to me by Zac Cichy after I tweeted about wanting to find some kind of identity to my tech blogging. The fact I didn’t come up with it myself frees me to say that I, personally, think it’s a pretty great name. While the name could mean many things, the six colour header and quote mark it as clearly Apple / Tech related.\nThe other alternative was to use AndyNicolaides.com, which I still own, but am not currently using. The unfortunate thing about this is my name is a bit of a mess and it would never stick in people’s minds for long, and if it did they’d soon forget how to spell it. It goes without saying that if you can’t spell a domain name, you certainly wont be going there very much.\n\n[…]\nMy issue, which is completely on me, don’t get me wrong, is that I feel I’ve painted myself into a bit of a corner with the name The Dent. While I have a love for technology, I don’t always want to talk or think about it. I feel that the name of this blog gives off a certain expectation, however. This feeling has held me back from posting more often, and of varying topics.\n\nAs someone who did make the decision to move from Rocket Panda to my own name, I think that if you feel like the name is blocking you from expressing yourself completely then change it to something else. I will say that you shouldn’t do this unless you truly are convinced the name isn’t “you” anymore. Rocket Panda was a one off name I came up with in the shower and liked it because it meant nothing, but over time I felt it to be a very weird website to explain to people and what the name had to do with it.\nI changed my domain and not a single person seemed to notice or care. Maybe that is because not many people read this, but it was nice to not get so much flack for changing the name of my site.\n",

Christopher and I both have talked about the podcast being more than just about the iPad, and we have been making strides to do that over the past few months. So no, A Slab of Glass isn't going anywhere.\n\nAfter about 2 months of it collecting dust, I decided it was time to say goodbye to my iPad Pro and consequently the iPad Lifestyle. There are a couple of reasons for this, but I will stick with the one that is worth talking about: I simply don't use an iPad anymore for my work.\nNo, this isn't a \"you can't get real work done on an iPad\" article. I have gotten real work done on an iPad for years and loved it, but due to some changes in my life the iPad isn't the best tool for the job anymore.\nThe big one for me is editing and processing audio. I use iZotope RX 7 for cleaning up both of my own podcasts and the podcasts I edit in my freelance work. There isn't a great alternative on iOS that compares to iZotope RX 7, which leaves me to crack open my laptop whenever I need to edit podcasts. Because of this I have moved all of my podcast editing to my MacBook Pro. A lot of my time is spent editing podcasts nowadays it makes little sense to me to move from a MacBook to an iPad for the minority of the work I have left.\nIf I am being totally honest, it isn't just the editing that makes me want to use my Mac over the iPad. I'm not sure if it is me not always happy with certain limitations on iOS or if I am just used to the Mac, but something about the Mac allows me to work with less friction. I am almost positive this is a mental thing with me and not the limitation of the iPad that is causing this, the MacBook just seems much more appealing to me when I want to get to work on something involving a computer. Whether it's writing, editing podcasts, editing photos, managing email, or simply browsing online, the Mac just fits to me more than the iPad.\nI loved my iPad and it wasn't easy for me to come to terms that I simply am not using it, but I needed the extra cash and I would rather sell it than have it collect dust on my desk.\nIt will be a significant transition to only have an iPhone and MacBook Pro but I think it was still the right choice for me in my life today. Maybe one day I will decide that is no longer the case and move back to the iPad more, but for now it is just me and my MacBook Pro, and I am happy with that.\n",

      content: "It's no secret that I write a lot about blogging on Rocket Panda. I have a thing with going meta, I even used to host a podcast about podcasting before Rocket Panda even existed. That said, sometimes it can be fun to go down memory lane.\nYesterday I was migrating my website over to micro.blog1 and I noticed something about my writing style over the last two years. There's been a stark contrast in my older posts and the ones I write now, and I wanted to talk about it.\nMy older posts were me trying to imitate and mimic tech journalists like that of 9to5Mac and TechCrunch. I was trying to be more journalistic and matter-of-fact without adding anything personal to them. I even tried to make myself sound like and Apple expert, but if I am being honest with myself I know little about the history of Apple and the impact they made before 2008, which was when I jumped into the Apple ecosystem.\nOnce I realized that wasn't working out for me, I moved to doing things like listicles and have my Top 10 iPad Life Hacks and The 9 Things I Learned Going iPad Only. I look back at both of these kinds of writing and cringe, because desperation has a foul and pungent scent and I reeked of it. After I got over how much of a try-hard I must have looked like I realized that had I not done those things and looked in the mirror afterwards I wouldn't have come to the conclusion I have today about what it is I want to write about the things that I'm passionate about.\nIf you look at my more recent pieces, I am writing more personal pieces about the things that I can add personal input on. I have written things like Why iOS 13 Made the iPad Home Screen Fun Again and my TouchType Pro Review2. These things are comments on the news from Apple and the companies that cater to those users, but I center it on myself and my feelings on it instead of trying to make this an article for TechCrunch or something similar.\nIt is much more satisfying for me to comment on the smaller things that I'm comfortable speaking on instead of trying to get my share of the pie with what the rest of the big Apple blogs are commenting on. There are times where I may add my feelings and opinions on something but only when it is something that I am comfortable with. Gone are the days where I try and do some quick research and reading up on something that I know nothing about just so that I can be with the rest of the Apple News cycle. It is great if you enjoy that but I found it to be extraordinarily draining both mentally and emotionally. Chasing that forever-spinning wheel of tech news is not something for me.\nIf I am still staying honest, it's hard to make a blog about the Apple news as a single independent writer. That faucet is broken and it is just a firehose of information shooting out at you with an unlimited supply of water. I have tried being a part of the firehose and it's simply not for me. I would rather be a trickle of water by myself for a small amount of people to drink from. Which brings me to why I have moved my site to micro.blog.\nWhy I Moved to Micro.blog 3\nThe reason for this is two-fold:\n\nI am not a Pro Blogger, and I need to stop acting like one\nThe atmosphere at micro.blog isn't as formal as something like WordPress for me, and I like that\n\nWhen I say I am not a Pro Blogger I mean that I don't have hundreds of thousands of readers, and I don't think I necessarily want that. It isn't a goal in my life to make Rocket Panda anything other than a way for me to express myself creatively. I don't look at stats, I don't see what posts are getting the most clicks, and I definitely don't want to make my site a digital billboard with ads everywhere and videos playing automatically. That wasn't the case when I first started though, I wanted to make Rocket Panda my full time job so badly. So much so I was willing to throw a piece together I thought would get lots of clicks and subscribers instead of writing something that I was happy with.\nWhat I want when it comes to this blog is that I own every pixel top to bottom and that I can say what I want, when I want without worrying about upsetting anyone that has control over my livelihood.\nAs for the second point, micro.blog is a place for me I consider a much friendlier atmosphere than that of Twitter or Instagram. There's nothing about this service that makes me upset or feel inadequate about myself. It is just writers and bloggers sharing their lives, thoughts, ideas, and photos with others. As someone that doesn't have a staff of writers it can be lonely at times writing, and having the ability to be a part of a community that isn't culturally toxic and genuinely delightful helps fill that void for me.\nI could have kept my blog on WordPress and linked it to micro.blog, but for me it made more sense to just put all of my chips in this service and embrace the limitations it comes with. I am happy with my setup and I hope to see it stick, and I think that this time it will.\nAfter some tinkering and playing around I finally figure out how to fix my biggest gripe with the service, which was differentiating the micro posts (the things I would post on Twitter) to the articles (like this one). Because of the addition to categories and the support for Hugo I managed to figure out how to add parameters to my site to hide my micro posts from the website but still have them post to micro.blog for those who follow me there. For those interested, I found the answer to that from the Hugo Discourse which is a group of helpful individuals4.\nThis isn't me saying that you should move to micro.blog, that is for you to decide. That said, I do think that more bloggers should look I the mirror and answer the tough questions about what they are writing about and what they want to share, because it took me way longer than it should have to listen to the people who told me to write more personal posts over the bland lists and news articles I was writing.\n\n\n\n\nMore on that in a bit&#160;&#8617;\n\n\nSorry Salman if you're reading this, I still haven't sent the review unit back to him.&#160;&#8617;\n\n\nI have since moved back to WordPress because of wanting to have link posts work the way I want, as well as having more granular abilities with the way my site looks. That said, the sentiment of being more informal is sticking with me.&#160;&#8617;\n\n\nI have bookmarked this site for future browsing as well if I ever decide to tinker with my website again&#160;&#8617;\n\n\n\n",

      content: "Something about this video makes me realize the real reason I am blogging on Rocket Panda instead of something like SquareSpace or Tumblr. It isn't because I think WordPress is a better platform, that is debatable on many different levels. The reason is because it’s my platform. I own every pixel of this website and I can control what goes on here and what doesn't.\nThis isn't about WordPress though, it is about the open web. If you are unsure what the open web is, I will let Mark Surman, Executive Director of the Mozilla Foundation, explain.\nMark Surman writing on Year of Open:\n\n  What is Open Web?\n  “Open web” is a sweeping term — it encompasses technical concepts like open-source code and open standards. It also encompasses democratic concepts like free expression and digital inclusion.\n  But there’s a single underlying principle connecting all these ideas: An open web is a web by and for all its users, not select gatekeepers or governments.\n  At Mozilla, we compare the open web to a global public resource, like clean water or the environment. The open web is something we all depend on: to communicate and create, to work and play, to buy and sell. And like any other natural resource, it’s fragile. It needs care, because it can be polluted: by harassment and abuse, by misinformation, by bad public policy.\n  Why is it important?\n  The web doesn’t exist in a vacuum, or apart from society. The two are deeply entwined. The web is where we engage with journalism, form opinions and share knowledge. It’s an arena for politics, education, culture and science.\n  An open web means positive progress for all these things. A more informed public; more civic participation; more opportunities to learn and connect with each other.\n  An unhealthy web has an opposite effect. When misinformation, harassment or surveillance proliferate online, we lose trust in our institutions and in each other. Fewer people engage. And when closed, proprietary technology proliferates, innovation and competition are stifled. The web is no longer a level playing field — it’s a platform controlled by a select few.\n\nWhile the main issue is governments seeking control of the internet, another entity is at work to wall up our content and lives: social media. I read somewhere a long time ago that you can't be playing in someone else's yard and then get upset when they kick you off it.\nIf Facebook one day decides that they want to close up shop all of the photos, posts, videos, status updates, and events you have put there are susceptible of going away forever. While losing a large part of your digital life can be catastrophic the thing that I think is much more dangerous is the freedoms you are giving up as a cost of entry into Facebook and Twitter and Instagram.\nThese social media giants aren't making these social networks just so you can stay in touch with friends and family, it is to get data and demographic information for marketing and advertisers. You are the product, and the more information these companies can get on you the better.\nThat said, Apple is planning to launch Sign In with Apple soon and that is a game changer in my opinion. You no longer have to use your personal information to log in to a service. You can now use great services online and in the App Store without having to worry about privacy concerns. This is the digital version of having your cake and eating it too.\nI plan to remove every piece of my Facebook the moment I get married this summer. I no longer want to be a part of a company I deem to be evil, and I don’t want to keep feeding them my personal data for a myriad of reasons.\nI guess what I am trying to say is when I want to share something on the internet I am going to do it on Rocket Panda, and I hope that you consider doing the same for your stuff.\n",

Now, gone are the days of mobile browsing on an iPad, and gone are the days where changes for iPhone are less-then-optimized for the iPad1. One of the things iPadOS offers in iOS 13 is the Today View widgets being pinned to the home screen of the iPad.\n\nNow, if you so choose, you can slide the widgets over from the left onto the home screen and always have them on the home screen of your iPad. This bodes well for anyone who wants to utilize the widget screen more, as well as those who want more whimsy on their iPad; because who doesn't want a little variety on their home screen?\nFor me, I think this is going to make apps with crappy widgets, or no widgets at all, push to make them more usable and feature rich. I haven't been one to use widgets because it's always been an \"out of sight out of mind\" thing for me. Now that it's on the home screen I think that this is going to make me rethink my entire iPad workflow. Apps like Timery, Eventail, and Shortcuts offer great widgets that I can tap to run actions or use to check on something without the need of opening an entire app. For example I can run a saved timer in Timery from the home screen instead of having to open the app and tap on it or running a specified shortcut. It all lives in the widget now and makes for things to be much more fluid and smooth.\nI think that the home screen for the iPad just got a whole lot more useful as well, because when the addition of the Dock on the iPad I rarely kept apps on the home screen. The Dock added a lot of utility to the iPad but with that came the question of whether to keep everything on you iPad in a folder or two within the Dock or still use the home screen even though it isn't as optimized for multitasking as the Dock was.\nAs of right now I am no on the beta but I plan to as soon as there is a build that is reliable. Once that happens, I think my new setup will be to have more things on the home screen because I will be going to it more and more thanks to this new addition.\nI'm looking forward to seeing what both developers and other users make of this once iOS 13 becomes available as a public beta, but until then I will be keeping an eye out for any apps that make significant improvements to their widgets and share them here on Rocket Panda.\n\n\n\nI'm looking at you Shake-to-Undo&nbsp;↩\n\n\n",

The issue is when I have so many things that it all seems to be too much.\nI can’t lose weight, eat healthier, plan my mornings, read more, learn something new everyday, save more money, and do one nice thing a day all the time.\nOne thing I have learned over the years about myself is that I plan and set all of these things I want to accomplish and hit the ground running with every single one of them simultaneously.\nDoing this seems plausible and honestly really exciting when I get started. But by day 5 I’m questioning whether I really need to go to the gym again, or I tell myself I am “too busy” writing a blog post to make a healthy lunch so I get McDonald’s again. “It’s fine,” I say to myself shoveling fries in my face, “I can afford one bad meal this week.” I am sure I am not the only one. You have probably done something similar, right?\nI’d like to take a page out of The Simpsons when I talk about these kinds of things, and call it the 3 Stooges Syndrome.\nhttps://youtu.be/aI0euMFAWF8\nAs you can see in the video, Mr. Burns is in for a doctors exam. Turns out he has so many illnesses his immune system won’t let any of them through the door because they are all prevent the other from getting in (cue noises from Curly).\nIf we dissect this a bit and spin it to make these illnesses into goals and resolutions you make foryourself, it’s obvious that having all of these grand plans you set means nothing was going to get through that door.\nI’m not saying goals and resolutions are illnesses, but I am saying that if you have too many you won’t be able to accomplish any of them. So what do you do?\nFor me, I had close to 10 different things I wanted to accomplish this year and I have slogged through them making zero progress on them. I wrote out all of these things on a piece of paper and really took a hard look at them. I asked myself why I want to accomplish this, what the outcome I wanted was, and what it will take to make this happen. I took an honest look at all of these things and then took an honest look at myself. What could I truly make happen this year? How many of these could I really get done? The answers for these questions made me look at these goals, resolutions, and plans and consider which are worth doing now and which are worth doing later. I decided I am going to do just one of these at a time, and move on to the next one after completing the first.\nIf I can get just one of these goals accomplished that’s still more than the 10 that were stuck in the proverbial door. One success is better that ten failures.\nSo if you are like me, and you can’t seem to make much progress on any of the myriad of goals you set yourself, take a long hard look at what you actually want to accomplish and keep the rest in your pocket until you get that first thing done.\n",

      content: "Joe Berkowitz writing for Fast Company:\n\n  As far as I know, scientists have not conducted tests about the long-term effects of sustained exposure to podcasts. I don’t need statistics, though, to fuel my suspicions that walking around listening to other people’s voices all the time, and allowing that to become my default cognitive setting, has probably warped my way of thinking and sapped some creativity. How could the constant stream of content not train me to be a more passive thinker, a spectator of life? Listening to other people’s ideas all the time creates a buffer that might be keeping my own ideas submerged in my subconscious. Almost everything I think while mainlining Doughboys or The Dollop or The Daily is a surface-level reaction to whatever I’ve just heard. There had to be a cumulative effect of my brain functioning like a YouTube comments section.\nLuckily, there was an easy way to find out whether being at Peak Podcast has taken a negative toll. All I had to do was hang up my headphones for a while. It was time for me to listen to something else: nothing.\nThe plan was to go on a two-week podcast fast. Two weeks may sound like laughably little time for such an experiment, but I was absolutely dreading it at the outset. It would be the longest I’d gone without a fix in nearly 10 years.\nThe other day I was watching a video on my iPad in my office, I paused it to go to the bathroom. I caught myself needing to grab my AirPods as soon as I pressed pause on the video so I can listen to a podcast for the 10 minutes I would be without some sort of media to consume.\nI also can't fall asleep without listening to a podcast. My mind swirls with ideas, questions, fears, and just randomness that is a carnival in my mind. The only thing that helps me with it is listening to something that will drown those thoughts out.\nNeedless to say this article came to me at the right time. I've decided to take part in the challenge for two weeks myself starting Monday. I am sure I will write about it on here, but until then the only podcasts I will be listening to are the ones I will be recording and/or editing.\n",

      title: "Oittm Charging Dock Station Review",
      category: null,
      content: "With the era of AirPower now behind us, the search for the right charging dock can be an arduous process. As someone who decided not to buy anything for their desk in hopes that void could be filled with AirPower, when the cancellation of it was announced I went on the hunt to find something to replace it.\nAfter some time looking at chi chargers, I wasn't impressed with any of them. Those that were appealing to the eye were not so appealing to my wallet. Eventually I decided to start looking at other options out there that are wired charging docks. Docks that have been on the market long before AirPower was even announced.\nWhilst looking at the options, Oittm reached out to me and offered to send me their Aluminum Charging Dock to try out. I normally don't take free merchendise to review but given my situation it seemed almost unfair to me if I said no. Two days later a package was at my home ready for me to get started putting it all together.\n\nThe build quality of this is a mix between aluminum base and stand with a plastic inside and top cover. On the outside sit 3 USB ports to plug in things to charge it with, and two USB ports on the inside for the Apple Watch charger and the iPhone charger to plug into. The base has a top cover hiding the small compartment where the 2 inner USB ports are, making the dock a lot less of a cable management device and more like a singular charger you can have on a desk.\nThis product has a clever way of using the wired charging cables in a way your desk still looks clean.\n\nAs you can see, the dock has a hidden compartment to place the charging cables so that you can have a dock with a single power cable running around instead of several Apple cables with separate plugs for each device.\nOnce you plug in the cables and have them set up in the dock you are set to go with charging both your Apple Watch and iPhone. I will say the it wasn’t a walk in the park to plug these cables in after having already fed them through their respective charging holes. Because of the small footprint, the compartment to plug in and hide the charging cables is a bit cramped. Oittm offers cable ties for the wires you are hiding but even when wrapped and tied getting the top lid to close wasn't an easy experience. I had to carefully maneuver these wrapped cables into the USB plug and then adjust the placement of these cables to allow for them to fit in that compartment. After about 15 minutes of setting this up I finally got the lid to close and everything was working fine. Thankfully, I never have to worry about setting this thing up again, because once it’s set you’re good to go.\nAlong with the ability to charge your iPhone and Apple Watch, the Oittm Charging dock offer 3 USB ports on the back of the dock to plug in other cables to charge your other devices.\n\nFor me this was a perfect addition so that I can use a micro-USB cable to charge my Kindle and an additional lightning cable to charge my AirPods. These extra cables don't stay plugged in all the time, but when I need them it is easy to plug them in and start charging the extra devices.\nThe added ports are great when you need them, and offer zero added space when you don't, making the footprint of this dock as minimal as possible, which is preferred for my small office desk I write on. All 5 ports are powered with a single AC plug, meaning that I no longer have to have several Apple bricks plugged in to my surge protector. I instead can have a single plug to power all of my charging needs.\nThe Oittm Charging Dock isn't a wireless charger, but if you can get over that small fact, this $35 dock offers a very sleek design that can handle a lot of charging power with a small footprint. It is a perfect addition to my office desk, and I highly recommend it to anyone in the same boat as me looking for an answer to Apple's charging problem. You can get yourself one on Amazon today.\n",

      title: "Touchtype Pro Review",
      category: null,
      content: "The Touchtype Pro is a new Keyboard case allowing iPad users to connect their 3rd generation iPads with the Magic Keyboard, and it is available on Kickstarter until May 17th. I received a prototype review unit from the creator of the Touchtype Pro, Salman Sajid, and this seems very close to the final product for me, and it is something I think many iPad users will love.\nThe Magic Keyboard\nThe Magic Keyboard was my keyboard of choice when it came to my 10.5” iPad Pro. I was never happy with the Smart Keyboard, nor was I thrilled with the Logitech Slim Combo. The only thing that came close was the Brydge 10.5 Series II, but even that was not a full sized keyboard, making my hands feel cramped after an hour of typing on it.\nThe Magic Keyboard wasn’t just my pick because of the size, it is also because something about the feel of the keys always felt like the perfect amount of travel and tactile feel for my taste. So for the last year of me using the iPad Pro 10.5” I had it accompanied with the Magic Keyboard. Now with this Touchtype Pro, I am able to use the Magic Keyboard in tandom with the iPad Pro 12.9”. This case has a lot going for it, but there are a few things I would like to see in the final product.\n\nLook and Feel\nThe quality of the look and feel of this keyboard is out of this world. I love the microfiber cloth inside the case. It is soft and feels like it is actually helping preserve the screen and keyboard from dust and grime. The outer shell is a cross between the look of plastic leather and the feel of polycarbonate, which is very pleasing in the hands as well as to the eyes. The craft put into this shows every single time I look at it or have it in my hands. It isn’t easy to make a keyboard case look good both open and closed, but I think that the Touchtype Pro is the exception to that. This case looks very business casual and can be something any workplace will be happy to see in use.\nUsing the Touchtype Pro\nThis Touchtype Pro brings the reliability of the Magic Keyboard together with the iPad Pro. Put simply it unites the best iPad with the best standalone keyboard. It allows people to write with the freedom of a full sized keyboard that is reliable and perfect for all typists out there.\nOne problem with the Magic Keyboard is you can only buy it as a white version from Apple, for me I think if there were a black version it would make this look even better. Secondly, the Magic Keyboard doesn’t have backlighting, making it a bit more difficult to write with when you are in a dark area, or if you are a night owl like myself and don’t want to wake up your spouse. However, if you're not in need of backlighting all the time this keyboard does have a function row as well as the knowledge that a spec of dust won't ruin it forever.\nThe process of folding and unfolding the Touchtype Pro takes some getting used to, and has a bit of a learning curve, but after a few tries I managed to get it down to a science. I am also a big fan of the train track of magnets allowing users to adjust the viewing angle of the iPad Pro to what ever angle you prefer when typing. For me, it seems to fit perfectly when I have the front flap folded over and the keyboard resting right on the edge. The case looks sleek and the angle is perfect for my eyes.\n\nThe design of this case is admirable with their choice to make it possible to fold away the Magic Keyboard and have a viewing only mode for when I just want to watch a movie or read a book on my iPad. This is something that other cases, including the Smart Keyboard Apple has made for the iPad Pro, don’t have. I miss the old 1st generation Smart Keyboard cases because it was created with a viewing mode in mind. I am not sure why other 3rd party keyboard haven’t done anything like that with their cases for the latest iPads, but it is refreshing to see someone make that decision, and the Touchtype Pro makes it easy to use.\nThis case does come with its flaws though.\nThe magnets connecting the keyboard aren’t strong enough to stay connected when I am moving it from a typing mode into a viewing mode. It also collapses on me when I am trying to quickly fold it up to take with me on the go. This isn't the case's fault entirely, I know that there were times I was too cavalier with me packing this iPad up and that caused me to be less than delicate on the case itself. If I gingerly move the keyboard away it works every time.\nI have spoken with Salman, the creator of this product, about this and he has expressed to me that the magnets in this prototype are not the ones going out to Kickstarter backers. Those who pay for the keyboard on Kickstarter or retail will be getting ones with stronger magnets to avoid this problem. After speaking with Salman on the phone about this I know he cares deeply about this product, and I have full faith that he will fix this before he ships them out to users.\nConclusion\nAll in all this keyboard case has a lot of great things going for it, and if you are someone like me wanting a full sized keyboard, the Touchtype Pro is a fantastic option worth looking into.\nThat said, this keyboard is $100 retail, and along with the case costing $100 retail, it makes this keyboard case setup the most expensive of any compared to Apple’s Smart Keyboard, Logtiech’s Slim Folio Pro, and the Brydge Keyboard. That said, you can get a used Magic Keyboard, like I did, on eBay for around $55. Making this less expensive than the Smart Keyboard as well as the Brydge Keyboard. So if you did have to buy both this case and a Magic Keyboard it wouldn't be outside of the competition.\nNow, if you are like many who already own the Magic Keyboard, a $100 case like this one isn't asking for a lot. In fact, I would argue that this case is worth $150 on its own. There isn't a case out there that offers this much versatility and usability for the latest iPad Pros. If I am being totally honest I am sad to have to send this case back as I see it being a keyboard case I can use day-to-day.\nif you want to get yours, act fast. You can get yours at a discount until May 17th by backing it on Kickstarter and find out more about it on their website.\n",

      content: "Steve Chabot and Adam Schiff writing for The Washington Post:\nAs members of Congress, we swear an oath to defend the Constitution, a pledge that includes protecting the First Amendment and its guarantee that the freedom of the press not be infringed. The prominence of this guarantee reflects the framers’ understanding that a press that could hold power to account was key to the success of the young American democracy.\nHistory has proved them prescient, and the United States’ model of protecting the press has served as a beacon for other free countries. It also reinforces our responsibility to stand up for press freedom in nations where the simple act of reporting the truth can lead to imprisonment, assault and even murder.\nOn May 3, we mark World Press Freedom Day, an occasion to consider the indispensable role journalists play in a democratic society and to call attention to the hundreds of journalists around the world who are in prison cells, or have been attacked, injured or murdered, for the “crime” of reporting. The Congressional Freedom of the Press Caucus was founded in 2006 to serve as a voice for the safety and rights of journalists around the world, to make clear that Congress stands with them and to hold the powerful to account.\nRegrettably, recent years have been some of the most dangerous and deadly in memory for journalists. Far too many have been taken prisoner or lost their lives in attempts to report news from such places as Syria and Afghanistan. And in a world where authoritarianism is on the rise, journalists are often caught in the crosshairs of regimes intent on restricting access to information to better control their populace.\nWe see it in the brutal assassination of Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi, who was murdered by agents of the Saudi government for his criticism of the crown prince and the kingdom.\nWe see it in Myanmar, where two Reuters reporters, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, were sentenced to seven years imprisonment for their reporting on the genocide perpetrated against the Rohingya people.\nWe see it in Venezuela, where the regime of Nicolás Maduro has employed violence, arrests and intimidation against independent media organizations.\nWe see it in Russia, where the Kremlin has mastered the art of spreading disinformation as a geopolitical weapon, while simultaneously implementing draconian laws to stifle dissent and free expression within its borders.\nViolence and intimidation of journalists has also struck close to home. Last June, five staff members of the Capital Gazette were gunned down in their Annapolis newsroom. In its latest report on press freedom around the world, the group Reporters Without Borders downgraded the United States to a “problematic” country. Just as we decry violence against journalists in other countries, we must speak out against attempts to stifle and intimidate the free press within our borders.\nThreats to independent journalism are the canary in the coal mine — they signal a toxic environment for democracy writ large. As the leader of the free world, the United States has a duty to speak out on behalf of journalists who risk their lives to report the news. The truth must not, and cannot, be silenced by a censor, a prison cell or a bullet.\n\nThe video in this article is also something everyone should watch today.\nIt's easy to take news for granted and even poke fun at it like how The Daily Show and Last Week Tonight with John Oliver do, and I think those are great examples of satire and parody. That said, what people don't always remember is that the truth comes at a cost, and sometimes that cost is the lives of journalists.\nSteve Chabot is a Republican Representing the 1st district of Ohio, and Adam Schiff is a Democrat Representing the 28th district of California.\n",

On this crucial day, we celebrate the freedom of the press, defend and support the independence of journalists, and honor those who have lost their lives while reporting a story.\nJournalists are increasingly under attack, thanks to the proliferation of fake news and direct attacks from celebrities and those in power. What’s more, dwindling salaries and budgets for newspapers, websites, and magazines translate to fewer resources to tell important and necessary stories. Journalists are being laid off in huge numbers at a time that a free and independent media is more crucial than ever.\nWe know just how vital journalists are to the fabric of our society and how stretched their resources can be. Journalists often put their reputations and their lives on the line to report stories. This means that they are often targets for doxxing, harassment, hacking, and other security nightmares.\n[...]\n\n  This is why we offer 1Password for Journalism, which is a 1Password membership for reporters that is completely free.

      category: null,
      content: "After buying my iPad Pro I have been looking at the box and the wallpapers that shipped with iOS 12. The swirls and ripples of color always caught my eye. After some time admiring it I rememebered watching a video from Field Notes on how they created their own similar effects with acrylic paint and thickened water. That process was called Marbling and after some quick searching I learned you can do something very similar on the iPad. Here are some examples I have made in the 20 wallpaper pack I have created.\n\n\nIt has been very rewarding to create art that I love, and it’s been therapeutic for me as well. If you want to give it a shot it is actually fairly cheap and easy to get started. Here's how I do it.\nThe app I use for this is Procreate, but from what I understand you can use other apps for this as well. So long as they have a Liquify effect you should be fine.\nOnce there I make a blank canvas for the size of my screen and change the background to my color of choosing — in most cases I choose black as that looks great on the new iPads and iPhones with OLED displays.\n\n\nFrom there you can start adding the colors you want to use for the Marbling. It is also a great time to play around with different brushes as well with Procreate. Alternatively you can import an image into Procreate and use that as your starting point for the Marbling. I did so with the artwork of the Supercomputer podcast at the request of Matthew Cassinelli and it turned out great (I also have it in the 20 pack of wallpapers below if you want it).\n\nOnce satisfied with the colors you have added, this is where the Marbling starts. Just tap on the magic wand in the upper left of your screen and select \"Liquify.\"\n\nOnce in the Liquify stage you will see a number of options on the bottom and sliders for those options. All of these are better learned through experimentation. It took me under 20 minutes of playing around to understand each one. I recommend you start using the \"Push\" option first and get acclimated with that. Don't worry about making things perfect when starting out. Your goal should be to make a mess and learn what each of these tools do before you really start making something.\n\nFrom there it is just a matter of getting the Marbling to your preference. Play around with the different options and sliders, you can always undo and action by tapping with two fingers or redo something by tapping with three fingers. Once done you should get something like this, or whatever you prefer to make. Remember, there is no right or wrong way to make your wallpaper art.\n\nFrom there just tap the wrench next to the effect tool you pressed earlier and share it out to the world (or your Photos app).\nThis image I made is part of the 20 images you can download here for free here.\nThe files are in a .zip file in Google Drive so if you want to get them on your iPad I recommend you use this Unarchive Shortcut and save the files to your Photos.\nIf you prefer you can download it via Dropbox as well.\nI am open to other color schemes and/or images you want to have Marbled as well. Just let me know on Twitter or via email what you would like and I will be happy to make it!\n",

I can create a decent website, a logo, and come up with branding ideas for a new project. That said, the moment I make this project public for all to see and get this proverbial plane off the ground I'm lost.\nIt is why I've changed the look of my website so much or moved my domain over. Everything is because I have this plane up in the air, but now I have no clue what to do next. So instead of pushing myself to learn more and keep moving forward I decide to crash the plane into the ground and start over. I repeatedly lift off again and again because I know I am good at that, it's the unknown that scares me into taking the plane any further.\nThe same goes for other things in my life, like video games. I have created 6 different players on NBA2K19 all of which I have played at most 4 hours on in total. I create a character, get it set up and play a few games with them but I eventually just want to go back and make new players and try new ways to improve the creation of them. My intention quickly deviates from playing with the character I just created to creating the \"best\" character I can.\nIt's maddening to a lot of people who see that I haven't found one thing to focus on. I have lots of little things I work on simultaneously. It reminds me of something I saw recently from the book Essentialism by Greg McKeown. What I saw was a diagram like this one, except instead of it being Focus it was energy. For me, focus makes more sense.\n\nTo sum this up, on the left side of this diagram of my focus with a lot of different things I am working on simultaneously. The arrows indicate how far I get into each one of them. I only have so much focus to give and if I spend all of it on lots of different things I won't get very far in them. On the right side is a different story. I focused on one thing and got much further than I did compared to the image on the left. When I saw this diagram for the first time it was one of those things that just clicked in my brain and never let go.\nI have always been someone that does the left side of this image. I get an idea, then another idea, and then another. I decide that none of these great ideas are worth keeping in my pocket for later and I just start doing them all at once. Eventually, after some time has passed, I have gotten little done on all of these different projects. Whereas if I had decided to do one at a time I would have completed them all faster and I would have given each project the focus it deserves to be better.\nMy Solution\nI am trying to be more mindful of this diagram and making it something that I consciously make a habit. Here are a few things I am doing to make that happen:\n\nI pick one thing to work on at a time as opposed to many. No new projects are started until I finish the one in progress\nI am keeping all of my ideas on a separate area in Drafts for later\nI am setting deadlines for myself to help keep pressure on the things I am working on, which in turn helps me finish things faster so I can work on something new before I get burned out\nI have made this diagram my new home screen\n\n\nAs someone that is a habitual offender of starting something but never finishing them I am excited to cross the metaphorical finish line more often. I am sure I will have more to say after a little while with this, but for now I am excited to make my work more intentional and less chaotic.\n",

Without burying the lede here is my home screen.\n\nFor those wondering, I made the home screen image myself using Pixelmator.\nAs you can see there is nothing on the home screen itself, everything lives in the Dock. My reasoning for this is that because the iPad is something that I fluidly move in between apps I rarely actually move to the home screen. There are a handful of apps on the Dock and everything that isn't readily accessible goes into a folder that I have organized where each page of the folder goes from most important apps to least important apps. So for my first page I have things like Google Sheets and Google Docs where a lot of the things I do for both my personal life and podcasts live. I also have apps like 1Password, Tweetbot, WordPress, and Ferrite which are apps I regularly use but aren't something I need immediately accessible.\nThe apps that did make it on my Dock are ones that I use every day and oftentimes within Split View. I have them in order of left to right from most used to least used. The reasoning for this is that because of the fluidity of the Recent Apps section of the Dock if I were to have the apps I use most frequently in the middle of the dock it can shift several icons left or right from when I last used it. Which is problematic for when I have a blog post idea or a task I need to throw in Drafts 5 before I forget it.\nHere's a quick synopsis of each of those apps.\nDrafts\nDrafts has quickly become my main text editor for pretty much everything in my life. From tasks, lists, blog post ideas, full fledged posts I am working on, and even just something I need to keepsake for a few minutes before I can toss it in the trash. Drafts has always had the tag line of \"where text starts\" and that is what Drafts has become for me.\nFiery Feeds\nThis has been my RSS reader of choice for some time now and continues to be the app I use most when reading stuff. With FeedWrangler as my RSS service of choice I look at the dozens of blogs, sites, news organizations new items all in one place. the sharing features it offers also satisfies my needs with Instapaper integration as well as Pinboard.\nGoodTask\nI have been battling finding a task manager that checks every box I want. So instead I decided to pick something that I haven't given a fair shake, which is GoodTask. I will probably be talking a lot more about this later, but for now it is getting the job done. It is also very Shortcuts friendly and has some decent Drafts 5 support thanks to Reminders being the foundation of this app.\nInstapaper\nI have been using Instapaper for a while now and it continues to be my favorite read-later service. It has great keyboard shortcuts and allows for folders to organize the various kinds of things I save to read later. Also, the Share Sheet is a treat to use anywhere I want to save an article or even just a link to the article.\nFantastical\nHands down the best calendar app for iOS, and arguable macOS. The natural language support makes adding tasks and reminders a breeze. I also have always been a fan of its look.\nAirMail\nThis is the most recent addition to my Dock, thanks to its sharing actions I can send my actionable emails to Reminders which syncs with GoodTask for future me to deal with.\nMessages\nThis is simply the way I communicate with nearly everyone in my life. There is a reason Messages is the most use app in iOS globally.\nSafari\nSafari is the browser I use 90% of the time. The other 10% is for iCab Mobile, which allows me to download files, view websites in desktops mode, and do things that Safari for iOS limits me on. For me iCab is a safety net for web browsing while Safari is my go-to app for anything involving a hyperlink.\nShortcuts\nI almost left this one in the folder, but I have been making more and more Shortcuts lately and having it available in the Dock makes things a lot smoother for when I have an idea for something I need to automate.\nFiles\nSimply put, I need access to my files and I don't want to spend time looking for the Files app in a folder or bringing it up in Spotlight every time I need it. It isn't perfect but it works for me when I need to save something or grab an item in my Dropbox and/or iCloud Drive.\nFinal Thoughts\nMy home screen may not be anything to write home about, but it is something that sets precedent of what is important for me when I am using the iPad. Hopefully my home screen inspires you to think about how you organize your apps and make any changes you deem necessary to make you happier.\nIf you want to share your home screen with me feel free to email me or send me a photo of your home screen on Twitter.\n",

      title: "Screw Being Perfect",
      category: null,
      content: "I recently took a course by Shawn Blanc about Ulysses and learned a ton about the premium writing application, but one thing that I loved just as much were the extra emails Shawn sent out after I purchased the course.\nMy main takeaways from the emails he sent were these:\n\nDon’t overthink things\nMake the time to write\nGive yourself permission to be crappy\n\nAll of these things are useful for someone like me who writes for fun and as a hobby on Rocket Panda. Honestly its just plain good advice for anyone doing something creative whether it is for a job or a hobby. I frequently look at these pieces of advice Shawn expressed and it makes me think about the one thing that I want to do more of as a blogger: consistency.\nThese four pieces of advice are perfectly in sync with my main issues in posting more frequently and making writing a daily habit for myself.\nDon’t Overthink Things\nOne of the biggest reasons I’m not writing and posting consistently is because when I begin writing a post I make sure it is absolutely perfect and I overthink the point of why I am writing on Rocket Panda in the first place.\nI created Rocket Panda because I wanted to share ideas, thoughts, and interesting things with like-minded people. People who love technology, automation, Apple, and other geeky things. I never got into this “blogging scene” to become rich and famous, I did it because I wanted a way to eexpress my love and interests with others.\nThere is a great video by Sean McCabe that is all about overthinking things and how creative people should stop doing it.\nAt first I thought this is something that’s easier said than done. After all, Sean has a successful business and podcast and I feel like I have hit a wall when it comes to growth in readers for Rocket Panda. After some time feeling sorry for myself, I realized that this goes in tandem with posting frequently and showing up every day to make those consistent posts happen. I know that the idea of “if you build it they will come” isn’t something that is always true, but it doesn't hurt to hit deadlines and make posting something you have in a calendar. If I say I will have a post live on a specific day I am more likely to post it rather than hitting publish after weeks of spending meticulous time making sure everything is absolutely perfect.\nSo instead of making things “perfect” I plan to make frequency and deadlines be my determining factor of when to publish. If the clock is racing and I don’t feel good about something I’m writing I am more likely to improve it and still hit my deadline in the process.\nMake the Time to Write\nWhen it comes to any craft you want to get better at, you have to make it something you do regularly. If you don’t then you’ll never improve in any significant way. This isn’t anything new for me but it is something I am reminding myself when it comes to writing. Which is why my goal every day is to write 500 crappy words at a minimum.\nIf I want to hit that goal of 500 words a day, I need to show up every day to write, and right now it just isn’t happening.\nThe thing that helped me with this valley of nothing was Merlin Mann’s talk at MacWorld in 2009 about the patterns for creativity. I have this video starting at 18:15 because this is where the nut of what got me started. The only thing you really need to know is that there is a book called Creative Habit by Twyla Tharp and when she is asked to do a project she uses these boxes where she does this thing called “scratching” which is her putting literally anything and everything that brings her inspiration. I recommend watching the whole thing to fully understand things but that is the very brief version of what led to this 5 minute section of the talk.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GExHiI_bQqc&amp;t=18m15s\nThere’s a lot to unpack in this talk, and maybe I will write more about it someday, but this got me thinking about why I haven’t been making the time to write. It was because I didn't want it enough.\nThis isn’t me saying you have to go all-in and work 18 hour days to make your dreams come true, but it is me saying that I spent more time trying to find inspiration from writers and bloggers who were at the level I wanted to be at. I was gawking at their work online wishing I was where they were instead of making the stuff I wanted to make. That isn't their fault though, it’s mine. I cared more about the idea of blogging and writing than actually putting in the work and making a commitment to myself to keep working on the things I want to be better at.\nGive Yourself Permission to be Crappy\nI am not as strong a writer as I would like to be, but if I allow that distance between where I am and where I want to be affect me then I would never write again. The only way that you can get better at a craft is to keep doing it over and over again and learn from your mistakes.\nI think it’s been made painfully clear that I am a perfectionist and I never allowed myself to just be okay with mediocrity, let alone being crappy. Still, I think if I allow myself to write 500 crappy words a day I will get better faster than if I wrote 1000 good words every few weeks.\nBeing perfect is overrated in my opinion. I say that knowing full well that has been what I’ve been striving for the last year writing on my blog. Honestly it’s just exhausting reading over your work a dozen times and making small and unnecessary edits. That said, there is a difference between being perfect and having something presentable.\nThis isn’t me saying that I will be drafting something up without proofreading and multiple edits. I still plan to do the work of combing through for errors and mispellings. The part I won’t be doing is going through what I have written actively looking for something to change just to change it. I want to keep things simple.\nChanges for Rocket Panda\nAll of this has come to a head for me and there are some changes effective today that will be taking place at Rocket Panda.\n1. I Will Write at Least 30 Minutes Every Day\nNow, 30 minutes doesn’t sound like a lot, but with that low bar of entry I have no excuse for myself to make the time to write every single day for 30 minutes. I have found if I spend that amount of time writing I am able to shake the cobwebs off and really start diving into more focused writing.\n2. I Will Post at Least Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday\nI will make a total of 3 posts a week on Rocket Panda. I may post more, but I am committing to 3. They might just be links to things I find interesting or longer articles that I spend lots of time writing. Either way I have set the precedent that I am posting on specific days and that this is my new posting schedule.\nIf I’m being honest, this is a safe space after all, I wanted to commit to more than 3 posts a week. I wanted to go daily but I know that the one day I miss posting I will kick myself for it and lose all sense of control. I have been there before and I stopped writing for weeks because I was too busy beating myself up for not meeting the exceedingly high bar I set myself. I want to avoid that this time so I have lowered the bar for myself and will start out with 3 posts a week and see where things take me afterwards.\nThe first post of the week starts today with this one. The next scheduled post will be Wednesday.\nOne More Thing\nOne of the biggest things that I want to stress and put out there for both you and me is that it is okay to not think that what you are putting out there is perfect. Perfection is what stifles my creativity and my writing process every single time I let it take precedent. I can’t move on to the next post until I make it published, and I won’t publish unless it is perfect. Screw being perfect, if I look back on my work and think I could have said it better that only means that I am improving on my craft.\nSo with these new promises I hope to achieve the goal I have wanted for a while and post consistently and create without overthinking things. If I can do that this year I would consider it a success.\n",

An external keyboard might be a temporary workaround.\nBut there is a clear distinction here: you have a course of remedy. You can take the laptop in for service or choose a different model. And while a failing keyboard is definitely a problem, it pales in comparison to someone’s permanent disability.\nCraig makes a great point here on this matter and I think that it is something many of us don't think about regularly, including myself. Apple has done great work for accessibility for those with disabilities and I hope they continue to do so.

      content: "This week for me has been all too familiar, meaning I moved my site from micro.blog to Wordpress again.\nThe reasoning for this doesn’t really even matter anymore because I have done nothing for the past several months but screw around with where my site is hosted instead of doing what matters writing. After hours of editing my new WordPress website, talking with support, and waiting for DNS changes to propagate I have finally managed to have Rocket Panda back up and running.\nI have mentioned it in the past, but I think one of the reasons I do this is because I treat my blog like a Lego collection instead of a platform. I try to make sure every block is perfectly put together instead of making sure that what I’m building is even worthwhile.\nI also feel like it is a form of procrastination. I would ask myself questions like, “How can I make time for writing on my site? I have so much I need to do to make Rocket Panda look better.”\nToday that changes.\nAs of today I have made a promise to myself to stick it out on WordPress and use a seriously simple theme called Tiny Framework. It is a simple yet effective theme that meets my simple blogging needs. It also allows for fast loading and processing. You add that to EasyWP, my hosting platform, and you have yourself a cheap and fast website that doesn’t need anything else.\nI have made the commitment to myself, and now with you all publicly, to not make any more changes to the hosting platform, theme, or aesthetics for the rest of 2019. The only exemption from this is if something is catastrophic to the website and requires me to make changes to it in order for it to be fully functional. Outside of that what you see is what you get. What you see may not be deserving of any design awards, but you can at least read what I have to say easily and not have any issues loading the site.\nMy reasoning for this commitment, and really a lot of things I get hung up about, is to stop worrying about the granular details and just keep things simple. I also needed to take stock in what was important for me on Rocket Panda, and for me it is the content. I would rather have a website that looks like it was built with a default template on Blogger in 2004 with tons of posts than have the most beautiful website with no content to show for it. So I am choosing to keep this less-then-beautiful website as-is and focus on what I want to say on it instead.\nWith this off my chest and the burden of making my website “look perfect” gone I can finally get back to what I made Rocket Panda for in the first place: to share my thoughts, opinions, and anecdotes about the things I care about.\n",

We apologize to those customers who were looking forward to this launch. We continue to believe that the future is wireless and are committed to push the wireless experience forward,” said Dan Riccio, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware Engineering in an emailed statement today.\nAfter a delay of over a year since it was first announced in September of 2017, the AirPower charging mat has become something of a focal point for Apple’s recent habit of announcing envelope tickling products and not actually shipping them on time. The AirPods, famously, had a bit of a delay before becoming widely available, and were shipped in limited quantities before finally hitting their stride and becoming a genuine cultural moment.\nAirPower, however, has had far more time to marinate in the soup of public opinion since it was announced. Along with recent MacBook keyboard troubles, this has functioned as a sort of flash point over discussion that something isn’t right with Apple’s hardware processes.\nEverything I’ve personally heard (Apple is saying nothing officially) about the AirPower delay has been related to tough engineering problems related to the laws of physics. Specifically, I’ve heard that they ran too hot because the 3D charging coils in close proximity to one another required very, very cautious power management.\nAs Stephen Hackett said on 512 Pixels said:\nThis is pretty unheard of when it comes to Apple, and I suspect the company won’t be pre-announcing hardware so far in advance any time soon. That said, I’d rather see the company kill a product than ship something that doesn’t work.\nHonestly I am glad Apple made some kind of decision on this. I am sure the AirPower jokes won't die anytime soon, but I would rather this era of Apple ends poorly than never end at all.\nIt also pains me to do this but.... #ChrisWasRight.\n",

Last time there was a major release, I wrote the&nbsp;Macstories Review. But when it comes to a Mac and how best to integrate Drafts into the macOS ecosystem, I'm simply not the right person to do the review justice. But thankfully, one of my favorite internet people reached out to me privately about writing the review for it, and I was thrilled to even be asked. To be clear: they didn't owe me that, but it is honestly a nice feeling to feel respected within this community. They also reached out to Federico about writing for MacStories, and he agreed.\nSo, it's my pleasure to point you not here for a review, but over to MacStories where&nbsp;Rosemary Orchard&nbsp;has written a&nbsp;review of Drafts for Mac.\n\nRosemary Orchard writing for MacStories:\n\nThe quest for the perfect text application &#x2013; for some of us it has been a lifelong goal, or at least it feels like it. I realised very early on in my computing life that I did not enjoy playing with formatting in Word or Pages, and when I discovered that Markdown provides the ability to make items&nbsp;**bold**&nbsp;or&nbsp;_italic_&nbsp;with just a few simple characters, I felt like I had finally found my text formatting holy grail.\nMany years ago I discovered Drafts for iOS, and the idea appealed: you open the application and type. No creating a new file, or trying to decide what to do with the text before the thought is fully formed, just open, type, then decide. I frequently need to jot down notes, save links, and have found being able to write without thinking too much about where the words need to go, and how they're going to get there, is extremely helpful in today's world of constant interruptions.\nLast year saw&nbsp;Drafts 5 released for iOS&nbsp;with even more capability than before, allowing you to truly customise it to be the text editor you've always dreamed of having. There was only one small but important snag &#x2013; no Mac version.\nToday there is a Mac app. It is what many of us have been waiting for, albeit with a few missing features at the moment.&nbsp;Drafts for Mac&nbsp;has landed.\nIt&rsquo;s great to see two of my favorite people on the internet write about the new Mac app for Drafts 5. I played around with the beta and Greg Pierce, the sole developer of Drafts 5, has been doing a fantastic job with it. I can&rsquo;t wait to see more improvements to come on the Mac app as time goes on.\t\t\n",

      category: null,
      content: "While I have mentioned it here and there on Twitter, I have been dealing with a lot of things regarding my mental health. Things that I think are common, like Imposter Syndrome, depression, anxiety about money, and stress from my job and from planning a wedding.\nThese things aren&rsquo;t new ideas people face, in fact it seems to be about as common as a cold. Plenty of people have had issues with money, careers, and some have planned a wedding too. After thinking about this and writing this post, I have seen some trends regarding &ldquo;burnout.&rdquo;\nMy generation has been told time and time again to go to college, do what makes you happy, and to follow your dreams. That is precisely what I did and I am working in the field I went to school for and I love my job. Yet, I still wake up anxious and afraid of what will come next. This isn't me blaming anyone for the path I took in my life, I am happy I went to school and I am happy with the career path I took. In fact, I haven't met someone in the millennial generation that seems to be an outlier from this mental health and cultural issue. This could possibly be just the people I associate with, but even those I talk to have mentioned something like this to me.\nIn a recent article from The Atlantic Sophie Gilbert mentions Tidying Up With Marie Kondo and how people define success and the burnout many millennials are feeling right now. It also goes into some other things like the Fyre Festival and how these two events are synonymous with the culture that the millennial generation brings. What got me the most, though, was how &ldquo;burnout&rdquo; was seemingly connected with success, but what is &ldquo;burnout&rdquo; anyway?\nThe majority of the video content that I consume is on YouTube and a recent trend I have seen by people like Casey Neistat is this open dialog about \"burnout.\"\nSaid Video of Casey on Burnout\nIn this video he comments on this article from The Insider about big YouTubers feeling burnt out and overwhelmed. Most of this video is about how when people attain this level of success they realize that to continue that growth they have to ultimately push themselves to their absolute breaking point and, frankly, bust their ass to make that effort equal or exceed their expectations.\nBut what if you haven't reached that level of success and you already feel burnt out? Does that mean you should just quit while you're behind? Or does it mean that you need to push yourself even harder to get over that dip?\nI ask not just because I want to bring about a different angle on this, but because that is where I am right now. To be completely transparent here, I haven't seen any real growth from Rocket Panda (formerly Tablet Habit) in several months. It just has this plateau of about 2000 visits a month. Which in blogging terms means next to nothing.\nThere have been several times where I decide that the best way for me to use my time is to work on a new design, or maybe even move my site to a new blogging platform, or even just change the domain to something else again. Which I know is about has useful as cutting off my foot just before I get ready to run a marathon.\nMost of the time I have these thoughts it&rsquo;s because I am afraid of just sitting down and writing. I am afraid because I worry that once I do I will see I have nothing to say, or what I do have to say isn't good enough. But as literally every great writer has said in one way or another, the best way to get better at writing is to actually write.\nWhat I am saying here isn&rsquo;t new and revolutionary. The problems I face aren&rsquo;t unique by any stretch of the imagination. With that said, I can&rsquo;t help but feel like this is something that is not being talked about enough, hopefully that will change.\nI also find these common problems for my generation to be indicative that millennials are more superficial than ever. For example, I would rather waste time on materialistic things instead of working to get better at my craft. &rdquo;If I can't be the best,\" I would say to myself, \"why would I want to put any of my time an energy into it? I should just go and try something else that I can be better at instead.\"\nI don't know the definitive answer to this problem but I think it starts somewhere with changing the mindsets of myself and others in this era of what success actually is. I am still trying to figure that out for myself, but it shouldn't be the number in our bank account or whether we have the more organized and optimized apartment.\nHow I am Changing My Mindset\nBefore I go into this, I absolutely know that this is something better said than done, but you can&rsquo;t start somewhere without taking that first step.\n1. Throw Envy Out the Window\nOne thing I am slowly starting to make a mantra is that your work should be like golf, the only real opponent you should measure yourself to is you.\nI have seen people I follow and consider my peers gain success in their own ways and I can&rsquo;t help be get a little jealous and envious of them for growing while I am not growing fast enough to my liking. This kind of thinking is how you get discouraged and throw in the towel. It isn&rsquo;t healthy to always be looking how well others are doing and comparing yourself to them. If anything it will drive you insane.\nWhat I plan to do instead is to look at how I am doing month-to-month. The things I want to look at are:\n\nRSS subscribers\nEmail Newsletter Subscribers\nPage Views\n\nWith these numbers I record them in a Google Sheet and see how they are trending and see what I need to do to either continue growing, or what I need to do in order to start growing these numbers.\n2. Quality of Quantity\nWhile I do want to keep an eye on the numbers, they aren&rsquo;t everything. One thing that I want to remember as I write and post on Rocket Panda, or really anywhere, is that there are people reading this. My readers are not numbers on a chart, they are human beings that I want to engage with and share things with.\nA trick I learned seem Chris Wilson was to act like I am writing for a blog or person I admire as if they were to read it. For me it is Federico Viticci, Serenity Caldwell, Myke Hurley, Stephen Hackett, David Sparks, Rose Orchard, Rene Ritchie, Merlin Mann, Alex Cox, Matthew Cassinelli, and John Gruber. All of them are  people I admire and hope to connect with one day. Some of whom I already have (listen to the episodes of A Slab of Glass with Rose Orchard, Matthew Cassinelli, Alex Cox, and David Sparks).\nIf I write something that is for the people I admire I feel like I am more considerate of their time, attention, and I write enough to make my point but I edit down as much as I can to not have too much &ldquo;fluff.&rdquo;\n3. Focus on the Rocks First\nThere is an old metaphor about a professor who came into class with an empty jar, he filled it with a few large rocks, then several small pebbles, then sand. The adage goes that you should focus on the big priorities in your life, the big rocks, more and then the other important things, the pebbles, and then the &ldquo;small stuff&rdquo; and material things in life, the sand. If you were to focus on the &ldquo;small stuff&rdquo; first you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to fit the rocks and the pebbles in there.\nThere&rsquo;s this great video that explains this better than I can.\nThe point of this, for me at least, is that priorities matter and in order to focus on these big things we first need to acknowledge what those things are. What do we care about the most? Family, friends, passions, careers. These are all good examples. But if we focused more on the small things like the latest tech gadget, whether we have the best phone or iPad, or other material and frivolous things we won&rsquo;t have the time and energy needed for the big rocks.\nFocus on the big rocks first, then the pebbles, and if there is time the sand.\n4. Get Organized\nIn order to find those big rocks, we need to get organized. For me, I have been bouncing around task managers so many times the last week I cared more about what app to write down the things I need to do rather than just doing them.\nWe all get swept up in the productivity porn of task managers and it can be fun to start using a new app or system; but if we spend all of our time on the app or system we aren&rsquo;t going to actually get anything done.\nSo I have decided on an app, which one is honestly not important for this article, and I plan to use this for 90 days without waver. I will write more about it soon but for now I am less interested in writing about the app and actually using it to get things done instead.\nI decided to use Things 3, the reason for this is because I have been going back and forth between this and Omnifocus and I decided to use Things 3 after flipping a coin to see which one would win. \nOnce I take the choice of the app out of the picture I can start focusing on the things that matter, which are the things I want to get done.\n5. Replace Social Media Apps on my Home Screen\nI am not removing myself from social media, but I am making social media a lower priority for me. When ever I get free time in the bank or at work or even at a stop light I immediately go on my phone and check Twitter.\nI have since replaced this with the app Tally to count how many times I open it in a given week.\nThis prevents me from sinking time into Twitter when I can be doing something better like reading articles on my Pinboard or an actual book. I also deleted Twitter from my phone and instead made it only available as a web app in Safari, which is blocked with 1Blocker. This makes it very much intentional for me to actually open Twitter for something and if I do so I have to jump through a number of hoops to get on it.\nLike I said, I am not going away from social media, but I am reducing my intake of it and making it very intentional in my life.\n6. Make Time to Get Centered\nWhen I am going through a very anxious or stressful period in my day I spend at least two minutes meditating to get myself back to the center. I know that I am stressed and I know something needs my attention, but if I don&rsquo;t make the time to decompress this will hit a boiling point that won&rsquo;t be good for anyone involved.\nMeditation is a new thing for me, so I have been using the app Calm to get started on it and learn more about meditation. So far, it seems to be helping me learn and use these meditation techniques at home, work, and even when I write. As of now, I meditate every morning and throughout the day when I feel that things need to be brought back to ground level. \nAs someone that has a history of depression and anxiety I am blown away with what meditation can do for me. I was a skeptic for a long time but as I get more and more into this space I am finding it to level things out and help subside my depression and anxiety at times. \n7. Never Quit Before Reaching the Starting Block\nWhen you are in a creative field, it can be common to have a feedback loop, a recurring thought that you aren't good enough or that you aren't doing enough, or something to that affect. I know because this is a very common thing in my writing process.\nIn fact, it has killed a lot of ideas before they had time to incubate long enough to grow into something. Sometimes it can be good to not spend time on something that you aren't passionate about. But when your reasoning is because you feel you aren't good enough that just stops you from even trying out something that could be great.\nI have been making a change to my line of thinking with my writing, namely to not kill them off before writing at least 500 words. That way I spend time writing out my thoughts and figuring out what it is I want to say. It has helped me write this very article, and it has allowed me to leave ideas in my writing folder to keep them in the forefront of my brain.\nThe feedback loops I have are still very much there but I have been working on not letting them make decisions for me.\nWhat's Next?\nWith all of these ways I have of dealing with burnout, it is still early on for me. I plan to keep at this and follow up next month. Until then, I would love to know what kinds of things you do to deal with things like burnout, Imposter Syndrome, and feedback loops. You can let me know on Twitter or via email.\n",

      title: "New Patreon Plans Coming in May",
      category: null,
      content: "From Patreon:\n\nWe&rsquo;re announcing new creator plans, which will be available later this spring. Current creators on Patreon will see no change to the fees they pay or the features they have, unless they are interested in some of the new stuff we&rsquo;re launching!\nPatreon has grown, and our community of creators has grown with us. We now serve so many different types of creators, from a painter with 100 fans to a creative business with 100k fans and a staff of 25. This allows us to tailor our offerings to different types of creators. We&rsquo;re also introducing new payment processing rates for future creators, including a new low rate for payments of $3 or less.\nThese changes will help us invest in the features and services all our creators depend on, and create a strong and independent Patreon that creators can build their businesses on for decades to come.\n\nFrom FAQ:\n\nWhy the New Plans?\nThe new plans better serve new creators by offering options, including more powerful tools for those that are ready for them. And they allow us to develop new features like Team Accounts and Merch for creators who really want them. We want to be around serving creators for decades to come. These changes set us on a solid path toward that goal, and will fuel investments in core product quality to improve the experience for all creators. Learn more about the plans.\n\nThe Plans\nPatreon Lite\n\nThis plan is for future creators who want a simple option to launch a membership without tiers and benefits that they can get up and running within minutes. This plan has no tiers; just a creator page with a &lsquo;Become a Patron&rdquo; button that allows patrons to enter any amount they wish.\n\nPatreon Pro\n\nThis plan includes everything Patreon creators have today plus some new perks! It&rsquo;s for creators who want more tools to build and grow a thriving membership. All creators on Patreon before the plans launch automatically get this plan at their current pricing.\n\nPatreon Premium\n\nThis plan is for established creative businesses with a large following who need advanced features and a higher level of service. Premium will have limited availability at launch. If you&rsquo;re interested in Premium, you can sign up to be notified when it launches.\n\nPatreon is also offering a new feature for Pro plans called \"Creator-led Workshops.\"\n\nWhat are Creator-led workshops?\nCreator-led workshops are livestreamed workshops taught by creators who are successful both on and off Patreon. We&rsquo;re introducing creator-led workshops because we&rsquo;ve heard from creators that they want to learn from other creators in their respective fields, i.e. musicians want to learn from other successful musicians, podcasters want to learn from other successful podcasters, etc. Creator-led workshops will cover topics like how creators are making Patreon work as part of their creative career, as well as other topics specific to the creator&rsquo;s field. As we build out the program, we&rsquo;ll be taking requests from Patreon creators to find out more about which topics you&rsquo;re most interested in.\nAre Creator-led workshops different than the Patreon workshops?\nYes. Patreon workshops are available to all creators on Patreon regardless of the plan they choose. They are taught by Patreon staff and focus on Patreon specific topics like optimizing your tiers and benefits and how to market your membership.\nWho are the creators teaching creator-led workshops?\nWe are currently building our roster of creator teachers.\n\nThe other new feature for Pro plans is \"Priority Customer Support\"\n\nCustomer support emails from creators in the Professional plan and above will be prioritized, with a minimum first response time of 6 business hours.\n\nPatreon also had their CEO Jack Conte explain in a video the new plans, which you can watch here.\nAs I mentioned in a previous article about Patreon changing their fees back in late 2017, Patreon has addressed that in their FAQ section of the page.\n\nHow is this different from the fee changes Patreon made in Dec 2017?\nIn December 2017, Patreon made some changes to the way we charge for payment processing, and within a week of the rollout, reversed the changes after hearing feedback from creators. There are 2 big lessons we took away from this event:\n1) We got in between creators and their patrons. Our plan in 2017 was to move payment processing fees so they would be paid by patrons instead of creators, and creators were frustrated by the decision. Moving forward, the right way to build a sustainable Patreon is to charge creators, not their patrons.\n2) The fee change we proposed overly penalized low dollar pledges. The new payment processing rates we&rsquo;re announcing for future creators will be transparent and predictable for creators as well as providing savings on small pledges. And current creators on the platform will see no change.\n\nPayment Processing\nWith these new plans from Patreon comes new payment processing for new creators. This is the breakdown of them.\n\nFounding creators: no change. You will keep the same processing rate you have today. Learn more.\n   Future creators: There will be two payment processing rates\nFor pledges of $1 to $3: 5% plus 10 cents per successful pledge\nFor pledges over $3: 2.9% plus 30 cents per successful pledge\nFor all pledges from patrons outside the US who use PayPal, regardless of the amount: An additional 1% per successful pledge\n\nThere is also a table breaking this down comparing what each of these new plans get which you can see here.\nMy Thoughts\nThere is a lot to unpack here and Patreon seems to be restructuring their platform to offload the smaller creators with smaller memberships so that the team can focus on the creators that are creating more revenue for the company. From a business perspective this doesn't seem nefarious or anything that would raise eyebrows. That said, we are talking about creators income and potential livelihood. Therefore, I will be watching one of there many livestream sessions they are offering. You can also sign up for them as well. They have many in different times available from March 19th through March 22nd.\nAfter I attend to the session tomorrow morning I will be providing more information and thoughts on this new chapter in Patreon.\n",

      title: "Ways to Make Money Podcasting Without Advertisers",
      category: null,
      content: "\n\t\t\t\tIf you have ever heard of Casper, Blue Apron, Squarespace, or Hover you&rsquo;ve probably listened to a podcast or two, and you&rsquo;re not alone. In a recent survey by Edison Research it is estimated 48 million people in the US listen to podcasts on a weekly basis, which is the highest it&rsquo;s ever been in the 12 years the survey has been going on.\n\n\nOf those people who listen to podcasts, 44% of them listen to &ldquo;most of the podcast&rdquo; and 43% of them listen to the &ldquo;entire podcast episode.&rdquo; Which results in a whopping 87% of listeners that are consuming most, if not all, of every podcast they listen to.\n\n\nThese numbers aren&rsquo;t just showing the rise of podcast listening, it is also indicative that podcasting is a growing market for business as well.\nA staple in revenue for podcasting has almost always been advertising in podcast episodes. For years many brands have seen podcasts as a way to get new customers to buy their products or services, and it seems to be working. According to a survey from AdWeek 65% of listeners said podcast ads increase &ldquo;purchase intent.&rdquo;\nThe one caveat that comes with podcast ads is you need a lot of listeners in order to consider making podcasting your main source of income. The number I have heard over the years to garner any attention from the premium advertising brands is around 5,000 regular listeners per episode per month. I then had this figure corroborated by Libsyn, the largest podcast hosting service.\nNow, this isn&rsquo;t something that is undeniably true, if you have a podcast about subscription boxes, for example, you could get someone like Loot Crate to sponsor your show. Or if you have a podcast about Top Level Domains companies like Hover could sponsor you as those listeners are much more catered to their product. It is all relative to what your podcast is about, but in general 5,000 listeners is where big brands start to look at your show as an avenue for advertising.\nTo put this into perspective, Libsyn posts their monthly statistics across all of their shows, here is what they found for the month of January 2019:\n\nThe median downloads per episode is 124 downloads per episode in 30 days.\nThe adjusted mean (meaning they threw out the top 0.5% of shows and any podcasts getting 3 or less downloads per episode) is 1491 downloads per episode.\nThe total podcasts that get 5,000 downloads or more, which is the sweet spot for advertisers, is only 7.1% of all podcasts on Libsyn.\n\nIn a nutshell if you want ads you have to beat 93% of all podcasts in order to make that a real possibility.\nThese numbers shouldn&rsquo;t be discouraging though, because advertising isn&rsquo;t the end-all-be-all way of making money in podcasting, in fact there are many ways you can gain revenue from your podcast directly from your audience.\nPatreon\nPatreon has become a Goliath over the years for creatives seeking support from their fans. Artists, writers, Internet personalities, and podcasts have all flocked to this platform because it has become one of the most popular ways for supporters to directly pay their favorite creators.\nShows like Do By Friday and Chapo Trap House are among the most successful shows on Patreon racking in thousands of dollars a month from their supporters. So, Patreon is the perfect place, right? The answer is much more complicated than you may think.\nWhile Patreon has garnered a lot of attention and recognition over the years it hasn&rsquo;t been without controversy. Back in 2017 Patreon made a public acknowledgement that they are lowering the amount of money they will be taking from their creators after criticism they received. In part, this is what Patreon said in late 2017 about the changes they were making:\n&rdquo;Aside from Patreon&rsquo;s existing 5% fee, a creator&rsquo;s income on Patreon often varied from month to month because of third-party processing fees. And, patrons may not have been aware that creators actually take home a lower percentage of their intended pledges because of those fees. Our goal is to make these paychecks as predictable as possible, so we&rsquo;re restructuring how these fees are paid.\nStarting on December 18th, a new service fee of 2.9% + $0.35 will be paid by patrons for each individual pledge. (To get into the details, existing per-creation pledges for posts made on/after Dec. 18th will be charged the new service fee; existing per-month pledges will first be charged a service fee on January 1.) Streamlining these fees for creators and patrons ensures that creators take home as much of their earnings as possible.\n\n\nWe want you to know that we approach every change with a creator-first mindset, aiming to help creators grow their businesses. In preparation for this change, we ran experiments and months and months of research to understand patrons&rsquo; potential reactions and we found that many patrons were happy knowing that this change will send more money to creators. While some patrons may leave in the short-term, we know this will help creators earn more money in the long term.&rdquo;\n\nAside from money, it can also be difficult hosting a podcast on Patreon. Stephen Hackett, founder of Relay FM told me in his decision to use Memberful, another option to offer paid memberships for fans,\n&ldquo;We had friend already using Memberful, and now Memberful is owned by Patreon. But I liked how you can make Memberful a separate system. We have dozens of plans, and Patreon isn&rsquo;t really meant for that kind of scale, and Memberful allows for that. It would have required a lot of hacking in the system to get it to work the way we needed it.&rdquo;\n\nEven now, Patreon still receives criticism for how much they take off the top from the creators on the platform, as well as the difficulty it can be having a podcast on their platform compared to other art forms. When I asked Patreon about their thoughts on the criticism they failed to respond to my attempts for comment.\nAmong those who feel Patreon is charging too much is Jamie Perkins. In part of this he decided to make his own platform for podcasters looking to monetize. He calls it PodFan.\nPodFan\nPodFan is a &ldquo;podcast first&rdquo; platform where podcast listeners can pay their favorite podcasters for extra perks. These perks could be things like merchandise, shout outs, access to exclusive content, a subscription to a newsletter, or all of the above. It also has the ability of offering a member-only feed for exclusive episodes and such. Jamie says,\n&ldquo;It is all about memberships for podcasts, so what that means is that it allows people to subscribe not just to your podcast, but actually with a payment. So they pay you monthly for any kind of reward you want to set up.&rdquo;\n\nOn the surface this seems very similar to Patreon but what sets itself apart is the pricing. Instead of taking a percentage of all money donated to the podcast Jamie has decided that PodFan will take a flat rate of $0.30 per subscriber. Which means you can offer members to pay $10 a month, and after that $0.30 is taken from PodFan you get $9.70 per subscriber, which is a 97% return. If you were to use Patreon, for example, you would be making slightly less. On the other hand, if you were to offer a $2 tier you would only net $1.70 after fees which is an 85% return.\nJamie does express his feelings that users on PodFan will make more money then they would on Patreon saying,\n&ldquo;I think you'll make more money on Podfan but also when you get a Podfan page it is podcast first.\"\n\n[...]\n&ldquo;With Patreon it is kind of open ended, and you have to kind of hack it a little bit to use it for how you want with podcasts, and the idea with PodFan is it is all podcast first and designed for people with podcasts specifically. So hopefully that makes it a little bit of a better option than Patreon. And I know that a lot of podcasters have had issues with Patreon with how they're skimming the payments and I know that a lot of people got frustrated with that payments model and I knew that I wanted to do a different payment model that is still sustainable but offers people a little bit more straightforward less chance for shady business operations, it is just more straight up transparent, clear, easy to understand.&rdquo;\n\nAfter seeing a preview of what PodFan will look like once they launch in the Summer of 2019, I have to say it is very well designed and something many will be happy to use. It offers many of the same things Patreon offers, but it also allows for a much easier experience navigating the pages of creators.\nBoth Patreon and PodFan are great options for single podcasts, but what if you have an entire network of podcasts you want to offer memberships for? The answer for co-fonder of Relay FM was Memberful.\nMemberful\nMemberful is a service that offers a way to have memberships for independent creators with a lot of flexibility. Relay FM offers several options for each of their 26 shows, including one to support all of the podcasters on Relay FM.\nStephen explained that sites like Patreon doesn&rsquo;t offer this kind of scale and Memberful was an easy decision for them as they already knew people using the service in similar ways.\nMemberships like this aren&rsquo;t the main way Relay FM makes their money though, they have advertisements on a majority of their shows. That said, Stephen does say that memberships like this is important for both the business and the listener.\n&ldquo;Relay makes money in advertising, the membership is good money but it is a relatively a small part of the pie still but its more about having a place and having a way to have a greater connection with listeners and and we get to support our hosts directly in a different way which is nice.&rdquo;\n\n[...]\n&ldquo;We do not offer ad-free episodes to our listeners. The overhead for that would be too great, the membership is more about extra stuff on top of what the public shows. So the big thing is in august and September every year every show publishes bonus member only content.&rdquo;\n\nThe one thing that may be worrisome for Stephen and Relay FM is that recently Patreon acquired Memberful. As of now, Memberful is still operating the same it did before the acquisition but Hackett has thought about what could happen if things change at Memberful saying,\n&ldquo;I know the team at Memberful, I&rsquo;ve spoken with their CEO in the past and they say that they&rsquo;re excited about their future and I believe them when they say that but at some point they may get absorbed, right now you would never know they were owned by Patreon, it is the same product it has always been. I guess we will see where that goes, for now we are really happy with he service and I&rsquo;m glad we&rsquo;ve chosen it and if we need to evaluate it in the future we will I guess. I do know that people use Memberful for specific reasons and unless Patreon mirrors all those features it isn&rsquo;t going to work for us.&rdquo;\n\nThankfully, according to Patreon after the acquisition, they don&rsquo;t plan on making any changes to the platform saying,\n&ldquo;The Memberful platform and brand will remain independent, the current product roadmap will continue at a faster pace, and existing creators using Memberful will not experience any immediate changes to the service. The Memberful team will continue supporting independent creators and building the Memberful service as part of Patreon. As it will operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Patreon, Memberful currently has a different pricing model than Patreon that is built around three tiers which will remain unchanged for existing customers.&rdquo;\n\nThe one thing of worry here, at least to me, is that who&rsquo;s to say Patreon doesn&rsquo;t pull the rug out from under Memberful and make them adhere to new guidelines and rules that can make things like the Relay FM memberships no longer be allowed? There isn&rsquo;t any kind of evidence supporting this is what Patreon is wanting to do but I also feel it isn&rsquo;t outside the realm of possibility.\nHonorable Mentions\nWhile Patreon, Memberful, and PodFan seem like great places to start there are other avenues you may want to look into that I felt are worth sharing, but not necessarily where you would be. one-stop shop.\nOvercast\nOvercast is not only a tremendous app for listening to podcasts, it is also one of the most popular. Creator of the app, Marco Arment, has also added support for having a special highlighted link in Overcast with some simple HTML code.\nRadioPublic\nRadioPublic is a relatively new venture from PRX that offers in-app tipping up to $100.\nI put this here as an honorable mention because I haven&rsquo;t used this app enough to really know if it is indeed something podcasters should start promoting.\nI will say, in my own experience with PRX, they know what makes good radio and have yet to show any signs of wanting to change podcasting for the worse.\nJake Shapiro has taken the reins of RadioPublic stepping down as CEO of PRX and becoming CEO of RadioPublic. Shapiro is a radio legend and has done tremendous work for public radio and podcasting; which is why I feel RadioPublic is in good hands.\nKo-fi\nKo-fi is a way for people to support creators with a simple URL and payment options, both one-time and recurring. Once you sign up you can share the URL to their Ko-fi page and people can tip you any amount of money they desire. This is also something I have seen creators use in the past, but it isn&rsquo;t something I am familiar with enough to go into great detail.\nKo-fi does offer a beautiful interface and website that explains what they offer any their story, which I think is worth checking out. They are also a &ldquo;PayPal Partner&rdquo; so you can use PayPal as a means for donating and receiving money with this platform.\nWhen Should You Start Monetizing?\nNow that you know all the different avenues you can look into to start getting support from your audience outside of advertising, there&rsquo;s just one question you need to answer: when should I start doing this? The answers I got when I asked them were very different depending on who I asked.\nJamie Perkins of PodFan says,\n&ldquo;I would say right away, because it is designed to be easy to set up. Once you've added your feed to Podfan and created your URL you have already created a PodFan page it;'s just a matter of setting up rewards after that. and then it&rsquo;s just there and its doing the work for you. But I think as with all podcasts you should always focus on your content creation as much as possible and let these services to offload all the other things you have to do with your podcasts and just be able to focus on your content creation as much as possible.&rdquo;\n\nOn the other side of the coin Stephen Hackett of Relay FM says,\n&ldquo;I think if you're looking at implementing something like this spend a lot of time thinking about what you're willing to do and for how many people and I think the answer is always to start small and work your way up.&rdquo;\n\n[&#8230;]\n&ldquo;If you're planning to do this just spend time really outlining the perks you want to do and if you have a bunch of ideas you don't have to roll them out in the beginning. You can use that as a way to promote the membership. You can only roll out with 2 or 3 perks. Especially if you are unsure of how many people you bring in.&rdquo;\nThe Case Against Monetizing\nMaking money from a podcast sounds great on paper, but in reality it amounts to a lot of hard work and dedication. It should also be stressed that the money you can make in podcasting will most likely not be enough to quit your day job. Very rarely do we see podcasters make podcasting their main source of income, and its because it isn&rsquo;t easy. There is a reason only 7% of all podcasts average over 5,000 download per episode per month. I plan to go more in depth about this later, but for now I want to make it well known that it can be difficult to make money podcasting; and you don&rsquo;t have to try and make podcasting a form of income.\nI personally have had podcasts that sold ads and it wasn&rsquo;t fun for me. I hated the idea of abiding by some set of rules for my show in order to sell ads for it. I was never happy with the money I was making from it, and I eventually decided I would never do advertising again for my shows. My reason for it was simply because I felt this unrelenting pressure from myself to overwork on my podcast and this previously fun thing I was doing quickly became a chore I was dreading. For me, podcasting isn&rsquo;t a career I am actively pursuing as a means of income. This is a hobby for me, it is something I enjoy doing for fun, and who wants to make something they do for fun into a job? For me that is a good way to never do it again.\nFinal Thoughts\nWhen it comes to monetizing anything creative it can be hard to get your foot in the door. Gaining some money for making what you love is something all creatives are excited to make happen, but those who do are sparse.\nI don&rsquo;t mean to make this sound discouraging but in my opinion you shouldn&rsquo;t be actively seeking to make money on your podcast until you have honed in on your craft and your audience. If you try to make money without having both of these lined up you will likely not see anything positive coming from you search to make money with a hobby.\nIf you have honed in on your show and you know what you want to do, I highly recommend you look around before you load up that pitch deck of yours. You may find yourself surprised by what happens.\n&nbsp;\nUPDATE: After publishing Jamie Perkins has informed me the pricing of PodFan is no longer $0.25 per subscriber, it is now $0.30 per subscriber. I have updated the percentages in the article. Jamie has expressed the price change will not happen again.\t\t\n",

      title: "Don’t Moleskine your blog",
      category: null,
      content: "\n\t\t\t\tNitin Khanna writing for nitinkhanna.com:\nI&rsquo;ve never been able to buy a Moleskine notebook. I&rsquo;ve often come across them in shops and stores, but every time I flip through the well weighted, elegant pages, which can give you paper cuts all day, I realize that I&rsquo;m not worthy of a Moleskine. My handwriting is terrible. My ability to sketch wouldn&rsquo;t save my life! Besides, the most important thing I want out of any notebook is the ability to scribble random ideas, or write small notes into. I want to just dump chicken scratch and small paragraphs in, without having to worry about elongating, or writing perfectly. Do I furiously scratch out words as I&rsquo;m writing? All the time.\nWould I ever want to use a Moleskine for that? No.\nI recently came across this post by Jeff Perry &#x2013;\n\nIt got me thinking &#x2013; do we sometimes treat out blogs as Moleskine notebooks? Do we worry that we must only present our best writing on them, instead of just putting our ideas out there, perfection be damned? Yes, we do. We write entire posts and then save them in drafts, only to forget them forever. Either we&rsquo;re not proud of our writing, or we&rsquo;re not sure if it&rsquo;s the right time to publish them, or we&rsquo;re unnecessarily being perfectionists. Whatever the reason, what happens when you open your blog the next time? You come to the homepage, or the admin dashboard, and what do you see? The drafts? No. That&rsquo;s a hidden page somewhere, totally ignored. So we move on to the next idea, and then the next, until our creativity is stifled and our spirits dampened by the lack of publishing. Why do we do this? Because the home page of our blog, at least in our minds, is a public space, and on it, only our best work should be displayed. But this is not true. CMSes allow two states &#x2013; logged in and logged out. When you&rsquo;re logged in, your blog&rsquo;s home page is, in fact, not a public space, but a private one. Most of us do not realize or understand this, let alone capitalize on this simple idea.\nI learnt about this problem in 2017 and solved it for myself. I want to share the idea with you, dear reader, so you can also stop moleskinning your blog. I&rsquo;ve alluded to me writing this post before, specifically mentioning a key aspect of my solution &#x2013; that when you see my blog&rsquo;s 2018 archive, you see 25 posts, while I see 59. Yes, that&rsquo;s thirty four posts that are not sitting tucked away in a drafts folder, but active and alive on my blog, albeit only for me.\nNitin has a really interesting way he treats his blog, and I think I may start using it myself. It may not be the perfect solution but it does seem to allow me to &ldquo;post&rdquo; without it being totally public. Even if he hadn&rsquo;t mentioned me on this I think it would have been something that would grab my attention.\nI also have been doing a lot of thinking after relistening to John Gruber&rsquo;s episode on Mac Power Users from 2015 on how he got started with Daring Fireball. He said, I am paraphrasing of course, that he first wrote feature articles meaning it was all his own writing without link posts or anything. Eventually he found he couldn&rsquo;t keep up with his consistency and started link blogging. I think I am in the same boat now that he was in back in 2004. Which is why you will probably see more link posts like this from Rocket Panda. That doesn&rsquo;t mean I won&rsquo;t be posting original content, it just means I will have more posts regularly in between the original feature posts I write.\t\t\n",

Omg I feel like that is a question Carson would know :),&rdquo; Griffith&rsquo;s friend responded.\nThe two reporters also relayed to human-resources instances in which they believed Griffith&mdash;who holds a management role at the site&mdash;expressed an uncomfortably negative attitude on issues related to workplace diversity.\nIn a Slack message reviewed by The Daily Beast, Griffith seemed to brag to Gawker staff that she had gotten them out of a company-wide diversity training session, though neither Kosoff nor Breslaw had asked her to do so. The two ended up attending.\nDuring one of Breslaw&rsquo;s interviews for the job, Griffith mentioned the snack selection at the office, and noted that she had a snack saved in her pocket.\n&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so poor person of me,&rdquo; she joked.\nKosoff additionally told HR of an exchange in which Griffith took a dismissive stance towards the recruiting of a writer who identifies as non-binary.\nKosoff, who was tasked with recruiting some new editorial staff, wrote in a Slack message that she was going to meet with a potential staffer &ldquo;who is a person of color and nonbinary (uses they/them pronouns).&rdquo;\nWhen she returned from the meeting two hours later, Griffith initially laughed off the preferred pronouns.\n&ldquo;lol is [name redacted] a girl?&rdquo; Griffith asked.\n\nI wish I could say that this surprises me, but nothing about Gawker shocks me anymore. I hope both Kosoff and Breslaw find better work elsewhere.\nAs for Griffith, I am sure she is happy with all this attention. Most villains in media are when they get attention, good or bad.\n",

The iPhone and iPad versions of the app, however, were left out. A lack of feature parity across platforms is always unfortunate, but that was especially true this time around because our John Voorhees &nbsp;highlighted Things as having his single favorite dark mode implementation.\nThere's good news though: we didn't have to wait long for Things&rsquo; dark mode to make its way to iOS. Launching today in version 3.8, Things has added two different dark modes on both iPhone and iPad, one of which is suited particularly well to OLED iPhones.\nCultured Code has been on my list for a while of developers that make the iPad great. Things 3 adding dark mode is one of my favorite things to see with Things 3. Sadly, I am still going to keep using OmniFocus strictly because it is the task manager that I consistently go back to when I am no longer \"on the market\" for task managers.\t\t\n",

      content: "\n\nToday I'm very excited to announce a book: Build Your OmniFocus Workflow. I've been hard at work on this for the last 3 months - but not alone. My fabulous co-author, Ryan Dotson, has been hard at work right along side me (admittedly with a timezone difference) - and we have 150 pages ready for you!\nThis book is designed, as the name implies, to help you build a workflow which works for you with OmniFocus - whether you've never used the app before, or if you've used it for years and just want to improve your setup. It is comprised of five sections:\n\nFirst Steps: Getting OmnIFocus set up with a basic setup.\nFundamentals: Walking you through the default perspectives, and expanding on your current setup - plus diving into settings.\nAdvancing: Diving much deeper, including custom perspectives, creative uses for tags, review and onwards.\nFinal Horizons: Honing your workflow to get the most out of your system.\nOur Workflows: Ryan and I get personal and tell you about how our setups work.\n\nThroughout the book there are tips, notes, personal comments, and most important of all: activities for you to complete in order for you to create a set up which allows you to be productive and which will hopefully also allow you to feel like you're fully in control of your life.\n\nRose has been doing amazing work as long as I have followed her and this is no exception. I bought this instantly and I am about halfway through it right now. While some of the things aren&rsquo;t new for me (I have been using OmniFocus off and on the past 5 years), it is still a great way to rethink how I use OmniFocus. I am taking this book as an excuse to start a whole new database and use the teachings of this book as my guide. So far, it&rsquo;s working great for me.\nGo buy yourself, or someone you know, a copy of this now before the price goes from $25 to $30.\t\t\n",

      title: "Blogging on a Mac Instead of My iPad",
      category: null,
      content: "\n\t\t\t\tLately I have been using my Mac more and more, and the reason for this is because I find it to have a much easier workflow for my writing than an iPad. This isn't to say that I can't do my work on an iPad, I can and I have, but because of apps like MarsEdit and Marked 2 I find that the iPad isn't my preferred device for writing anymore.\nOne of my reasons for this are the apps, and how they have improved my workflow when it comes to my writing.\nMarsEdit\nMarsEdit is probably the go-to application I will tell anyone who is using a Wordpress website to use. It has a solid reputation behind it, and it is all apparent after using it for you site. It is built a lot like a standard Mail application with each post being its own item and the data you want to see right there in rows. It allows you to see all your posts easily and select one that might need to be edited or shared.\nOnce in the editing mode it supports Markdown, HTML, and plain text editing. It is also a really nice Rich Tech editor similar to the WYSIWYG editor Wordpress used to have before moving over to Gutenberg. If you want Markdown syntax highlighting, this sadly isn&rsquo;t the app for you. I spoke with the developer some time ago and I got the feeling that Markdown syntax highlighting isn&rsquo;t something in the works. I could be wrong about this, and I hope I am, but as of right now there is nothing of the sort in MarsEdit.\nOnce you are done editing your post, things like the post title, slug, categories, and tags are all available to edit and assign prior to going live. The tags you even have saved on your Wordpress website show up when entering them in MarsEdit. You can even use custom fields for things like the Daring Fireball-style Linked List Plugin where you can enter in a custom field with a link and make that URL the hyperlink to your title. You can see a good example of that on my post about the new podcast by Greg Morris called And You Are?.\nFinally, this application supports image uploading, meaning that you can insert your image in a post on MarsEdit and when you do hit publish that image is then uploaded to Wordpress and attached to the post automatically. This isn&rsquo;t necessarily anything new as apps like Ulysses also do this. That said, it is a nice touch to not make users have to upload their images and then add them through some kind of library or manually copy the image URLs over.\nMarsEdit isn't just a very nice editing tool for blog posts, it also provides a wonderful array of admin tools as well. For instance, if you want to get the link to a post on your website, you can just select the post and press control+command+C and the link for the post is copied.\n\nNot only that, but with a simple plugin on your browser you can make link-posting on your website a cinch. Simply select the text from an article you want to share, click on the MarsEdit browser plugin and, with the power of the Quick Posts setting in MarsEdit, the link from the site where you selected that text is then formatted however you want for link-posting.\n\nAll in all, I think that MarsEdit is a great buy for the price, and if you give it time and really start using it regularly it can be the one and only application you need to post to your blog.\nYou can buy MarsEdit 4 today for your Mac for $49.95. Which seems high, but if you want a powerful one-stop shop for posting your blog, MarsEdit is by far and away worth the money.\nMarked 2\nMarked 2 was an app I didn't think I needed when it came to writing and blogging on the Mac, but once I finally used it I instantly added it to my workflow.\nMarked 2 is a simple app on paper, it allows you to open a file with Markdown and see real-time updates to it. Outside of what this does &ldquo;on paper,&rdquo; the flourish and polish of this app makes proofreading and quality control smooth and simple.\nAlong with adding bold text and italics whenever the syntax shows up, it does things like shows the full URL of a link when you hover over it.\nIt can show the length of selected text with things like world count and character count and sentences in the selection. It allows you to review and check the version your readers will see, making it the last application necessary before hitting publish.\n\nIt also has an incredible editing system to show you where you can improve on your writing and grammar. It reminds me a lot of the Hemingway web-app, showing where you write in passive voice, or when you are using words that have preferred alternatives. So instead of saying something is &ldquo;very large&rdquo; it could show you something like &ldquo;enormous&rdquo; or &ldquo;gigantic&rdquo; making for it to be a much more pleasing thing to read.\n\nFinally, Marked 2 also allows you to export the finished product as a slew of different file formats. You can save the finished post as things like a Markdown file, a PDF (paginated and continuous), or even HTML if you want to share it to something like MarsEdit and not have to worry about your Wordpress website supporting Markdown formatting.\n\nMarked 2 was the editor I needed when writing as I never feel that my work is worthwhile until I meticulously comb over everything and rewrite draft after draft. Now, with the editing tools and system I can use that as a finish line to when I can stop trying to make it perfect and start making it public.\nYou can get Marked 2 for $9.99 right now, or become a SetApp subscriber and get access to Marked 2, Ulysses, and a slew of other great apps.\nBringing it All Together\nNow that you know both the apps I cherish on the Mac when it comes to my writing, let's explain the process in my writing and blogging on the Mac.\nI first start writing my draft in a text editor. Which is usually Ulysses on the Mac, which can be an alternative to MarsEdit if you just want a text editor that can post to Wordpress. One thing I prefer with Ulysses is that it does have Markdown syntax highlighting, allowing me to see more clearly the differences I make when I want to bold or italicize something. However, I am not a fan of how Ulysses handles your posts after you send it off to be posted. It just stays right at the folder you had it in. From there I have to figure out what to do with it. Eventually what I decided to do was make a folder called &ldquo;Posted&rdquo; and throw everything I am finished with in there for safe keeping. Once that got cumbersome I decided to make Ulysses my app for writing, and Marked 2 and MarsEdit for editing and publishing respectively.\nAnyway, once I am done with my first draft I export the Markdown file of the post to Marked 2 and have both apps side-by-side and make changes to the according to the Keyword Highlight Drawer in Marked 2.\nOnce done there I send the post to MarsEdit. Once there I add the metadata I need and make sure everything in the post is how I want it. Once I am happy with it I then send it to Rocket Panda for posting.\nConclusion\nThe workflow is a little crazy seeing that I am using 3 apps to get one post out on to Rocket Panda, but I feel that if I were to exclude any of these in my blogging process it would make for a lesser product.\nOne thing that I think is something that I prefer over the Mac is just how easy it can be to edit posts and make changes with ease. When it comes to iOS and the WordPress app, which is the only decent app to handle WordPress content on iOS, it is still clunky and ill-fitting to the styling of iOS.\nWhen I am using MarsEdit and Marked 2 on my Mac it feels like it is the perfect way to make sure that my writing is the best that it can be.\t\t\n",

      category: null,
      content: "\n\t\t\t\tWhen it comes to GTD, the first thing you are introduced to is the idea of &ldquo;Capture.&rdquo; For the most part it&rsquo;s straightforward. You can&rsquo;t store your ideas without getting them out of your head, so you need to have a system in place to make it seamless and second-nature to go from idea to capture.\nWithout capture you have nothing but a bunch of things swimming in your mind taking up a bunch of space. With this in mind I knew I needed to work on the things that I was going to be using to capture my ideas and tasks. Which starts with what was coming into my life. So I started writing everything out and organizing the different things that come into my life that may require, action.\nAs you can see, there are a number of different things I use to capture my ideas, and many different types of things I need to capture. Which basically boils down to three categories: digital and analog.\nDigital Inputs\nFor the digital, I wanted to decide on apps to use to capture those things into my task manager of choice. What I needed was a way to send things from each of these sources to my task manager.\nEmail was the first thing and was simple to configure. A simple Share Sheet option made sending the emails I received to Things 3 a breeze. I also could set up an email account to forward to Things 3, but I preferred a share sheet option as it didn&rsquo;t require me to have to send an email to myself and clog up my messages.\nFrom there things like Twitter, RSS, text messages, and Overcast, I had to put these ideas and tasks into my system manually. As I use Things 3, I can either use Siri Shortcuts to input something or I could also have a Drafts 5 action in place to send anything I make on a new line to Things. Which isn&rsquo;t perfect, but it gets the job done without issue.\nFinally came my digital notes. This was ultimately the hardest thing to handle as I have been using a combination of Drafts 5 and Bear to handle my notes over the years. When starting from scratch I wanted to take a long hard look at what each of these apps are for, and I eventually decided that Drafts is where everything would start. I decided this because it made things easier for me to decide what I wanted to say and then think about where they go second. Instead of trying to think of whether what I have on my mind is better off in Bear or as an item in Things, I decided to forgo that line of questioning and make Drafts 5 my go-to input app. From there, I can send it to the respective app once I am done capturing my thoughts.\nTim Nahumck made a great point in his Drafts 5 review about this saying:\nAt its core, Drafts remains the app it has always been: a place where text starts. It is the quintessential app for trusted capture of text. There are other writing/note-taking apps out there that are great in their own right. Some are more suited for long writing and research, while others are good for simple note-taking. But none of them replicate the functionality that Drafts carries on iOS, where integrations built into the app provide powerful, customized actions. This is where the strength of Drafts really shines: it can be the central hub from which everything flows.\nDrafts 5 was always an app I loved. Now that I have real guidelines on how I am capturing anything in my digital life it makes Drafts 5 my go-to application for all of my text input.\nAnalog\nNow comes the more difficult area of my life, the analog stuff. There are times where I want to capture things in my Field Notes notebook over Drafts 5. The reasoning could be as simple as I don&rsquo;t have access to my phone or iPad at that time, or that I want to sketch something out and using my hands is faster than using a keyboard or iPad. In both scenarios I write in my notebook and now have to capture it digitally into my task manager or note-taking app.\nOriginally I thought scanning my notes and saving them in Bear would be sufficient, but after a few tries with that it made searching a pain. So now I make it a point at the end of each day to go through my notebook and decide what stuff I want to digitize in Drafts what things I don&rsquo;t. This is technically part of the processing section of GTD but as I see it moving things to one cohesive system is so important I have to make it a habit I never break. For me, i consider it more a capturing process over actual processing as I am just throwing these items in my &ldquo;Inbox&rdquo; of Things 3 and deciding what to do with it later.\nWhile my notebook and my digital input covers 95% of my life, there are still instances where snail mail and other paper documents appear and I need to find a way to handle them in my GTD system. Which leads me to one of the most important things I have learned in GTD: having an &ldquo;In&rdquo; box at your desk.\nI take these paper documents and keep them in my &ldquo;In&rdquo; basket by my desk and make it a point at the end of my day to, along with looking over my Field Notes, go through and add these documents to either my reference material (Bear) or my task manager (Things 3). Again, this is technically processing but I think it is still worthy of mention here before I really dive deep into the processing section of GTD.\nConclusion\nIn short, I think doing this project allowed me to not only get a handle on what things I have coming at me at a regular basis that requires my attention, but I also now have formed a better understanding of how to manage them all in one trusted system. Which, if you ask me, is the hardest part of this whole GTD process.\nSo now that I know what I need to do for every kind of input in my life and what apps and workflows I need to accomplish them, the next thing I want to cover is processing, which will come next in this series.\nUntil then, feel free to share with me how you capture your tasks and ideas on twitter. I would love to hear your workflows!\t\t\n",

      title: "Brydge 10.5 Series II Review",
      category: null,
      content: "\n\t\t\t\tIf ever there was a time for me to talk about keyboards it is now that I have my Brydge Series II in hand.  This keyboard was something that I was long waiting for and now that I have it in hand I think this is the perfect keyboard for me.\nMy History with Brydge\nI was wary of this purchase after having more than my fair share of issues with the original keyboard Brydge came out with for the 10.5 iPad Pro. I had to send it back 3 times and after the 3rd time there was no charm and I eventually told Brydge to refund me in full. I was left with a horrible taste in my mouth from this company and I vowed to never give them my money ever again.\nThat all went out the window after hearing about the new Series II from Brydge and how it seemingly fixed all of its quality problems I had previously. I was elated to hear this and after some thought I decided to make one final exception for Brydge and gave them my money, and boy am I glad that I did.\nThe Pros\nThe Brydge Series II looks identical to the form factor of the original, the only thing that changed was the reliability of this keyboard was increased exponentially. No keys would fail to type, there were no more sticky keys, and the Bluetooth connection stayed true. It worked perfectly.\nThe Brydge keyboard has loads of features and checks every 99% of the boxes I had when it comes to a keyboard for the iPad.\nThe first is the layout of the keyboard allows me to touch type without issue and allows me to really fly on this thing without worrying if the key I am wanting to write with is going to work correctly or not. Not to mention, this keyboard doesn&rsquo;t skimp out on anything, offering media keys and having arrow keys that aren&rsquo;t squished and difficult to feel for. Finally, it has a dedicated home button to go back to the home screen with one press and to the multitasking view with two.\n[caption id=\"attachment_2110\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"4032\"] Brydge Series II Arrow Keys[/caption]\n[caption id=\"attachment_2108\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"4032\"] The Dedicated Home button[/caption]\nNot only is the keyboard layout something that warms my heart, the fact that this offers backlit keys is also a treasure to me. It is still something that baffles me to see Apple only offer backlit keys on MacBooks and never on a Wireless keyboard. I know that because of the size of the Smart Keyboards it isn&rsquo;t feasible, but if Apple were to update their Magic Keyboard to offer backlit keys it would have been an instant-buy from me. I don&rsquo;t use backlit keys often, but when I need it and not have it a small part of my brain goes berserk. Having my keys backlit allows me to write late at night while my fianc&eacute; sleeps and not have to have any house lights on1.\nDownsides\nThe only downside I found with this keyboard, like so many others I have tried, is that it is Bluetooth instead of using the iPad Pro Smart Connectors. Seeing that this keyboard is specifically made for the 10.5&rdquo; iPad it makes sense to me to have the connection to the keyboard be the Smart Connector instead. With that said, no one other than Apple and Logitech have ever made attempts to use the Smart Connector.nAfter speaking with a Brydge representative their reasoning actually made a lot of sense saying:\n\nHere at Brydge we deliberately chose to use the Bluetooth 3.0 over the Apple Smart Connector as this technology does not limit our fundamental design. The Apple Smart Connector restricts the experience to a single viewing angle, while the Bluetooth 3.0 enables the flexibility to deliver a unique laptop like 180 degrees viewing angle.\n\nWith this in mind, this decision is actually something I feel is the better choice than to make the iPad only viewable in one angle. Even with the new Smart Keyboard, there are only two angles, one of which could be argued that is never used. So seeing that Bluetooth was the better option, it makes sense that is what Brydge went with instead of the Apple Smart Connector.\nConclusion\nIt is clear that Brydge has made gigantic strides to right the wrongs they may have inadvertently made in older models of their keyboards, and it is a breath of fresh air to see a company that cares so much about design be equally caring on the quality of their new products. As someone who has an &ldquo;older&rdquo; iPad Pro, seeing them update their products for this not only goes to show that they truly want to allow everyone to get their hands on something to write with, but also indicative of what is to come in their line up for the new iPad Pros.\nThe boycott is over from Brydge, and I couldn&rsquo;t be happier with my decision to buy this product, and if you want to make you iPad Pro equally beautiful and functional, there isn&rsquo;t anything better the Brydge.\n\n\nThe only light I use is a desk lamp as it isn&rsquo;t as illuminating as the overhead light in the office. &#8617;\n\n",

      content: "\n\t\t\t\tKatie Floyd from Mac Power Users Forum:\nAfter nine years and more than 450 episodes, the time has come for me to say goodbye to Mac Power Users.\n\nNever in my wildest dreams could I have imagined the success of this podcast or the opportunities it would create. I would not be where I am today, personally or professionally, without this show. I owe a debt of gratitude to our sponsors, listeners, and most of all, to my co-host David Sparks. You have lived with me through life, loss, new homes, careers, and nearly every other significant milestone. Throughout it all, MPU has been there.\n\nTo everything, there is a season. I&rsquo;m turning to a different season in my life. December 31st will mark my last episode of Mac Power Users. I have not come to this decision hastily, it&rsquo;s something David and I have been talking about for several months and the end of the year seems a natural time to wrap things up.\n\nThe show will go on. We are pleased to announce Stephen Hackett will be the new co-host of Mac Power Users with David starting in January. I can think of no one better. Stephen is passionate about the Mac platform, and I am confident leaving knowing that the show is in good hands with David and Stephen at the helm.\n\nStephen Hackett on 512 Pixels:\nKatie is leaving big shoes to fill, and it&rsquo;s why I was deeply humbled when David asked me to step in as his new cohost. I am beyond thrilled to announce that I will be taking up the mantle on Mac Power Users starting in January.\n\n[&#8230;]\nDavid and I have been hard at work planning our first episodes. If you are a MPU listener, let me put your mind at ease: we aren&rsquo;t radically changing what has made the show so good for so long. We will still be diving deep into topics, comparing apps, interviewing guests and getting our nerd on about all sorts of topics.\n\nIf you don&rsquo;t subscribe to Mac Power Users, I&rsquo;d encourage you to check it out. It&rsquo;s pretty different from my other shows, and a challenge I look forward to meeting each and every week.\n\nMac Power Users was one of the first tech podcasts I ever listened to and I have had a long-standing relationship with this podcast.\n\nI was just listening to an older episode about setting up a new Mac (more on that later) and I just loved the back-and-forth both David and Katie had about David first getting an iPad Pro, then later &ldquo;stealing the thunder&rdquo; from Katie after buying a new MacBook Pro like she had. Something about the two of them doing that show was infectious and one of the few podcasts I would have go straight to the top of my queue when it came out.\n\nI think Stephen will be a good match as a co-host with David. To be the yin to his yang as Katie said. It is sad (but also exciting for Katie&rsquo;s &ldquo;offline life&rdquo;) to see Katie go, but I couldn&rsquo;t have thought of a better person for her to pass the preverbal baton to then Stephen Hackett.\n\nI look forward to what the next few episode of MPU will hold with Katie, and I am equally excited to see what comes in the new year with David and Stephen having a podcast together.\t\t\n",

      content: "\n\t\t\t\tAs of today Tablet Habit is now Rocket Panda. Before I go into the full reasoning  why I wanted to share with you what has been going on with me for the last few weeks.\nTo make a long story short, I have been having a bit of an issue defining my blog. As I have said before, Tablet Habit was a blog for me to explain how I use the iPad as my main device and it was a way for me to express my love for iOS and the iPad. That all changed once I started using my 2017 MacBook Pro.\nI started to slowly move more and more things to my Mac and less work on my iPad. Which brought on something of an identity crisis. I gained readers because I was an &ldquo;iPad guy&rdquo; and drifting away from that seems like I was cheating my readers out of what they wanted.\nMy first idea was to move things from Tablet Habit over to Mac Habit.\n[caption id=\"attachment_2076\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"4000\"] Logo for Mac Habit I made[/caption]\nAfter a lot of work building a new website from scratch and importing all of my old posts over, Mac Habit was inches away from taking over Tablet Habit. I was excited, nervous, and anxious to show everyone the new website I was going to be using. But then a question popped in my head.\n&ldquo;What makes Mac Habit any different than Tablet Habit?&rdquo;\nThe original answer I had was Mac was a more universal term for Apple blogging, and it was something that wasn&rsquo;t tied to anything other than Apple. It wasn&rsquo;t a device-specific name like Tablet Habit. Which sounded fine, but I wanted something even more freeing than Tablet or Mac as my name.\nI spent days, even weeks, trying to come up with a new name. Then, during a shower I was taking the name Rocket Panda came to my head and I loved it. It wasn&rsquo;t specific to any kind of topic or idea, and the name stuck with me like glue. If you ask me what it means, I will say it is just a cool name that I enjoy, and that Rocket Panda doesn&rsquo;t need a topic or underlying meaning. It is just something that is catchy and easy to pronounce and type out without any kind of mispronouncing or misspelling. In short, I like the name way more then Tablet Habit or Mac Habit.\nSeeing as this is my blog, and has always been a personal endeavor for me, having a name that isn&rsquo;t tied to a specific topic seemed to be the right choice.\n\nThis website will still have all the things you loved about Tablet Habit, including all the old posts. The only change you will notice about this site is that it has a new name and a new color scheme to match the flames coming from the Rocket Panda logo. I may deviate from posts about Apple, but this is and forever will be a personal blog where I share my thoughts on things. It will always have my authenticity in it and I like to think people read my stuff because of my personality I put to the page, not the topics that I write about.\nIf you want to follow Rocket Panda on social media or make sure you have the right RSS feed subscription you can find all the links below. If you have any questions, comments, concerns feel free to mention Rocket Panda on Twitter or email me directly.\nI thank all of you for being loyal readers and sticking with me over the last year with Tablet Habit. Here&rsquo;s to many more with Rocket Panda!\n&#x1F680;&#x1F43C;\nLinks\n\nRocketPanda.net\n&#x1F680;&#x1F43C;.ws\n@_RocketPanda\nRocket Panda RSS Feed\n\n",

      content: "\n\t\t\t\tOne thing I think that was most interesting on the new Apple Event Keynote wasn&rsquo;t the new devices, but the fact that Today at Apple was given time on stage.\nFor those that don&rsquo;t know what Today at Apple is, it&rsquo;s a series of workshops that Apple Stores offer for anyone to come to for free and learn things you can do on the Mac, iPad, and iPhone. I am sure there are others as well, but it&rsquo;s been something that hasn&rsquo;t been talked much about in the Apple tech community.\nThe Today at Apple workshops may not be geared towards those who are tech savvy. With that said, Apple giving time for it on stage today in between the release of some much-needed updates (Mac Mini and MacBook Air) and interesting innovation (iPad Pro) shows that Apple isn&rsquo;t just here to make you think that your iPad Pro 10.5&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t good enough anymore. They want you to harness that power with what ever device you have.\nAs Tim Cook said in the keynote after they announced 60 all-new sessions coming to Apple Stores, it is something that no one else has.\nFor me personally I have never been to a session, but after today I have been looking at upcoming events and workshops at my local Apple Store and am very seriously considering making the 55 minute drive to go to one of these.\nSome sessions mentioned in the Keynote include Siri Shortcuts, and a session called Small Screen Magic which is all about making short movies with the Clips app. They also provided an interesting background with other new sessions that are intriguing to say the least.\nApple really outdid themselves today with the new devices. But I think they equally outdid themselves 18 months ago when they launched Today at Apple and made it possible for their users to learn from the team at Apple just what kind of things they can make on their computers.\nIt is also worth noting that when this part of the Keynote happened the entire audience at the Brooklyn Academy of Music went into an uproar of enthusiasm and excitement. It is indicative just how important sessions like this can be for users, and I can&rsquo;t wait to see what I have been missing out on.\t\t\n",

      category: null,
      content: "\n\t\t\t\tWhen I started reading Getting Things Done, I was in a spinning world of chaos. I had many different plates spinning at the same time and no way of making sure that nothing fell through the cracks. I needed a system.\nSo, as a challenge to both my co-host of A Slab of Glass, Christopher Lawley, and myself I set out to read the book Getting Things Done by David Allen cover to cover to see just if GTD was something that would work for me. After chapter one I was all in.\nI wanted to use this methodology immediately. I did brain dumps, set up a task manager, and started making boat loads of contexts and tags and folders. I thought I was finally getting to where I wanted with a system that worked for me. The reality was that I was on a high setting up all these productivity things, and I was no closer to getting my work done.\nIf I am being honest, I was even further from getting the big things in my life done. I did all the things I thought I needed to do to get my life in order and start Getting Things Done, but in reality I just took the foundation of the methodology and ran with it, without thinking on a much higher level.\nI was worried about having a task manager that handled everything I threw at it, without actually throwing anything at it. I put the cart before the horse, and that is where I think a lot of people end up when starting a brand new productivity system. This all stops now for me.\nI have decided that over the next several weeks I will be starting from scratch in Getting Things Done, and do what David Sparks suggested when he was on A Slab of Glass episode 19:\nDo not try to create an entire system in a day. I think what you should do is you should make a list of things you want to improve. What are the key elements of a task management system? There&rsquo;s capture, how do you capture tasks? How do you process tasks? How do you complete tasks? How do you review projects? Those are the big 4 steps. And pick one of those and say, &ldquo;How am I going to get better at this?&rdquo; And do that for two weeks, or a month, or two months, or whatever it takes to just internalize that and say, &ldquo;Okay, I am just crushing it on capture, now how am I going to process tasks?&rdquo; If you try to do it all at once it&rsquo;s just overwhelming and nothing sticks. It&rsquo;s just like learning keyboard shortcuts or anything you do. Bite off small pieces and fully digest them. And then take another piece, but don&rsquo;t try to eat the whole elephant in one bite, you&rsquo;re going to have a problem.\nSo the first thing I am going to work on is capturing. I need to figure out a system that will work for me and what will allow me to make capturing thoughts, ideas, projects, tasks, and anything else that comes to mind. I need to make it second nature to take those ideas in my mind and put them somewhere I will go back to later to process them.\nAll of this will be part of an ongoing series on Tablet Habit I like to call &ldquo;Learning GTD.&rdquo; Capturing will be part one of this new series, and I can&rsquo;t wait to share this journey with all of you as I try to make my life more organized and less chaotic.\t\t\n",

      content: "\n\t\t\t\tJack Nicas writing for New York Times:\nIn a quiet corner of the third floor, Apple is building a newsroom of sorts. About a dozen former journalists have filled a few nondescript offices to do what many other tech companies have for years left to software: selecting the news that tens of millions of people will read.\nOne morning in late August, Apple News&rsquo;s editor in chief, Lauren Kern, huddled with a deputy to discuss the five stories to feature atop the company&rsquo;s three-year-old news app, which comes preinstalled on every iPhone in the United States, Britain and Australia.\nNational news sites were leading that day with stories that the Justice Department had backed an affirmative-action lawsuit against Harvard University &mdash; a good proxy that the story mattered, said Ms. Kern&rsquo;s deputy, a former editor for The New York Times whom Apple requested not be named for privacy reasons. He and Ms. Kern quickly agreed that it was the day&rsquo;s top news, and after reading through a few versions, selected The Washington Post&rsquo;s report because, they said, it provided the most context and explanation on why the news mattered.\n[...]\n&ldquo;We put so much care and thought into our curation,&rdquo; said Ms. Kern, 43, a former executive editor of New York Magazine. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s seen by a lot of people and we take that responsibility really seriously.&rdquo;\nApple has waded into the messy world of news with a service that is read regularly by roughly 90 million people. But while Google, Facebook and Twitter have come under intense scrutiny for their disproportionate &mdash; and sometimes harmful &mdash; influence over the spread of information, Apple has so far avoided controversy. One big reason is that while its Silicon Valley peers rely on machines and algorithms to pick headlines, Apple uses humans like Ms. Kern.\nThe former journalist has quietly become one of the most powerful figures in English-language media. The stories she and her deputies select for Apple News regularly receive more than a million visits each.\n[...]\nApple&rsquo;s executives grandly proclaim that they want to help save journalism. &ldquo;There is this deep understanding that a thriving free press is critical for an informed public, and an informed public is critical for a functioning democracy, and that Apple News can play a part in that,&rdquo; Ms. Kern said.\nFor me, I will always choose human over machine when it comes to getting news, and Kern seems to be the perfect person to lead the way for the Apple News team.\t\t\n",

      category: null,
      content: "One of the biggest things I do when I make podcasts is write show notes. I do this on both my podcasts A Slab of Glass and Getting Caught Up. Writing show notes can be a tedious affair and difficult to search through the backlog of episodes, but with this shortcut it allows me to be able to search and find every single episode&rsquo;s show notes in seconds.\nWhat this Shortcut does is take a specific formatting I use when writing my show notes and makes those top 3 lines the name of a file, with some text formatting.Format Used for Show Notes in Drafts 5[/caption]\nAfter I have my show notes written in Markdown format, my format of choice when writing, it is time to make the magic happen. It first gets the line count of the text I have shared to Siri Shortcuts. From there it saves it as a variable for the count.\n&nbsp;\nOnce done, the shortcut grabs the first line of text from the input, in this case it is the podcast name. From there, it saves the first line as a variable called &ldquo;Podcast&rdquo;. Now it is on to the next line, the episode number.\nFor me I like to write it as \"Episode ##\" so that it is clear for me to read, but I don't want the word &ldquo;Episode&rdquo; in the name of the file when saving it. So to remove it I use a Find and Replace Text action to find \"Episode \" and replace it with nothing, effectively deleting everything but the literal episode number.\nFinally, it takes the 3rd line, which is the episode date. I format my dates the way I am most comfortable with (MM-dd-yyyy). However, I am using hyphens as a means to break up the three different areas of information, so to avoid using hyphens in the naming process of the date I find and replace hyphens to make them underscores. Now the formatting of the date is MM_dd_yyyy.\nNow, with all these lines saved as variables, the shortcut takes the original input of the text (all show notes, including the top lines), and sets the name for it to be the three variables I have saved, all with hyphens between them. Which makes it look something like \"A Slab of Glass-19-10_19_2018.\" When equates to A Slab of Glass, Episode 19, released October 19th, 2018. From here I save the text as a .txt document in Dropbox for safe keeping and search-ability if I ever need it.\nOnce saved, if you open the .txt file you will see it has everything as it was when I wrote it, just with a name that is now searchable and easy to distinguish among other files when needed.\nYou can find the workflow here and try it yourself. If you make some improvements or changes feel free to let me know on Twitter.\nThis shortcut is just something that shows the power of Siri Shortcuts when it comes to editing text and making it your friend in the world of automation.\nI plan to add more to this later on. Things like saving the file in the podcast&rsquo;s respective show notes folder in Dropbox, and adding the podcast episode title in it as well. For now though, this is something that allows me to be organized and never have to think about where I left those show notes again.\n",

      content: "\n\t\t\t\tAdobe recently announced that Photoshop is coming to the iPad, and with that comes talk of how the iPad is once again on the precipice of gaining the ability to be a &ldquo;Mac replacement.&rdquo;\nFor me, this seems a bit trite and something that isn&rsquo;t a matter of if or when, the iPad is a Mac replacement if I ever saw one. In fact, I have been using my iPad as a main computer once again since the release of iOS 12. I haven&rsquo;t picked up my Mac for more than a few minutes a handful of times.\nI do still use my Mac, don&rsquo;t get me wrong, and I think it is an amazing machine. With that said, it isn&rsquo;t necessary for my workflow of writing, reading RSS feeds, designing minimal graphics, and managing the backend of my websites. All of this can be done on my iPad with ease.\nSo why did I decide to crack open my Mac? Because when I needed to do something quick, it was easier for me to use a Mac app that I was already familiar with than to try and find a solution on my iPad that would have made this quick thing I had to do an entire project. If I really wanted to go iPad only, those quick and easy things I do on my Mac would become projects and learning sessions on my iPad. It isn&rsquo;t impossible, but it isn&rsquo;t something that I can make time for right now.\nWith all this said, there are times where I will make a conscious effort to make the switch from an app on the Mac to something on my iPad. A recent example of this is going from Adobe Photoshop on my Mac for graphic design to Affinity Designer on the iPad.\n\nThe reason for this is two-fold. The first being that I wanted to make more logos and designs with an app that is actually meant for designing rather than using a photo editing tool as a means to making logos. Adobe Illustrator came to mind, but I have had issues with RAM on my Mac when using that app on my Mac. So, I decided to look into other alternatives and Affinity Designer was one that I felt was an obvious leader for the iPad. It had all the features I would want a Pro app to have, tutorials to make my life easier when learning this new system, and an affordable price tag to $19.99.\nAfter downloading the app, I spent an hour or so watching tutorials and just playing around with the application to get a grip on what all this system can use and what things I could look into for my own work. The UI is brilliantly placed and allowed for a busy and cramped space to look like it was crafted specifically for the iPad instead of cramming a desktop version of an app into a smaller screen haphazardly.\nThe apps Affinity has put together allow for it to be a seamless and simple solutions for people looking for a pro application to edit photos and design works of art, but they aren&rsquo;t the only ones.\nApps like Lumafusion and Ferrite also allow those working with video and audio to be iPad only as well. They not only are great solutions for using an iPad for videos and podcasts, it can be your main way of editing. The Mac isn&rsquo;t necessary anymore to make that YouTube Video or create the podcast you always wanted to. It wasn&rsquo;t that long ago when you needed a high-end iMac or Mac Pro to edit videos to meet the expectations of critics and film reviewers, and most importantly ourselves. You go on YouTube now and look at videos made entirely on the iPad and they are some of the most creative and impressive pieces of art I have seen online in the past 18&#x2013;24 months. One I highly recommend is that of Serenity Caldwell&rsquo;s iPad Review.\nThere are a lot of premium apps with premium prices on the iPad, but not nearly enough for everyone to see that the iPad is a &ldquo;Mac replacement.&rdquo; Personally, I think it would be better to see apps like Logic Pro X and Final Cut X get full versions of the apps on iOS. Having Apple tout that the iPad is a great alternative to the Mac and Windows Tablets but not have the premium apps to back it seems counterintuitive to me and I think for people to look at the iPad more than a Facebook and Netflix machine, they hav to put their money where their mouths are.\nDespite my criticism on Apple not providing apps that are pro apps, I will say that there is no tablet in the Android, Chromebook, and probably the Windows ecosystem, that is as beautifully designed and well thought out as those on the iOS ecosystem, especially the iPad. If I were to look for something like Affinity Designer and Lumafusion in a Tablet form I sincerely doubt I would find anything that is as close to the intersection of beauty and function like those available on the iPad.\nIf ever there were a time to think about replacing that old MacBook Air with an iPad, I would say that time is now. With Adobe releasing more iPad apps in 2019 and almost certainly new iPads coming in the next month or two, I think right now is the perfect time to think about what you can do with the iPad and really consider if it can be a replacement for you in your day to day work and life. For me, it absolutely is. I may crack open my Mac once in a while but it by no means is because I need it, it is just that I don&rsquo;t have the time to learn how to work around those specific things I use my Mac for still. One day I think I will, and probably have an easier time with it thanks to iOS apps like Drafts 5 and Siri Shortcuts to make things as easy as one singular tap.\nPro apps on the iPad are here to stay, and I think having Adobe coming into the game to bring full-featured versions of their apps is a great thing for iOS and the iPad.\t\t\n",

Creating and finding Workflows to meet my needs were worth their weight in gold, and sometimes allowed you to make using your iPad more favorable than the Mac.\nI, for one, felt that Workflow was so good at bringing together apps that don't normally talk to each other. Seamlessly moving items from one app to another all while maintaining the integrity of the file was a game changer. Workflow was the singular app that made me want to pull out my iPad over my Mac. That is until Apple acquired it.\nWhen Apple announced the acquisition of Workflow my heart immediately sank, I felt that Apple was trying to squash Workflow and other automation applications for iOS. Instead, a new iteration of Workflow was created with some advanced features that control first party applications and settings.\nHonestly, this news still hasn't sunk in that an app that is a unicorn in the iOS platform has gained so much capability. While I only have been using is for a few days, it is clear that Siri Shortcuts has revitalized my excitement and delight in working with iOS.\nSiri Shortcuts hasn't changed much from its Workflow origins as far as how the app works and the things you can do with it, but something about this makes me more excited than ever to automate and simplify the complex things I do with my iPhone and iPad. Working in this app has allowed me to see the true potential of the iPad again and has made me leave my Mac unopened on my desk. I believe the reason I am so infatuated with this app is because the worry I had when Workflow was acquired has subsided. Between the announcement of the acquisition and the announcement of Siri Shortcuts I felt I was in between a rock and a hard place where I wanted to use Workflow's powerful tool but I also didn't want to sink time into an app that seemingly had a likely demise. I didn't want to use Workflow as a crutch to do my work on iOS because if Apple decided it would \"sunset\" Workflow my entire computing workflow would be null.\nAs we now know that was far from the case, and having that subconscious mental block leave me I have been using Siri Shortcuts every moment I can to build and play with the things that it can do. It reminded me of when I started Tablet Habit a year ago and had delight and excitement every time I would open my iPad, I finally felt that again with the iPad thanks to the revitalization of using powerful automation tools to make the tedious work on an iOS device as simple as a single tap.\nI plan to share a lot of the Siri Shortcuts I have built over time, and if you have any questions or requests from me feel free to contact me on Twitter or email me and send any and all questions my way!\t\t\n",

In fact there are a number of choices that seem to have some sort of drawback no matter how you look at it.\nI like to to think of iOS keyboards like that of trail mix. By that I mean there are lots of options, but you are never satisfied with what you get.\nThe Peanut\nThe Magic Keyboard is the peanut, simple yet reliable and gets you where you are going. However, it is missing the sweetness and delight that you want. With no backlighting and a Bluetooth only connection, you often have to wake it from its all too frequent sleep mode just to get the keys to work with the iPad. Sure you can simply tap an arrow key when you want to use it, but when it is such a prevalent and repetitive thing to do it becomes tedious and tiring.\nThe Sunflower Seed\nThe Smart Keyboard is the sunflower seed. Small and plentiful, but doesn't provide enough sustenance in its own. The Smart Keyboard is the most frequently recommended keyboard for an iPad Pro, but it doesn't check all the boxes. Again, with no backlighting working on the keyboard in a dark room just doesn't work. Now as a step up from the Magic Keyboard it does have a Smart Connector, but with that comes sacrifice in keyboard size. Especially in the 10.5 iPad. The key size is small, space between keys takes some getting used to, and even some less used keys are squished to fit the footprint necessary to be used as a Smart Cover.\nThe Raisin\nThe Logitech Keyboard is the raisin of the bunch where some people like and is \"healthy\" competition in theory. In reality it sucks and nearly everyone hates them. Honestly the bulky keyboard ironically named Slim Combo seems to be a slap in the &nbsp;face to the people who decided to buy it. It has a Microsoft Surface knockoff okickstand in the case making the footprint of this keyboard when in use take up more space than any other keyboard I have used. It does have backlighting, but the keys are even more cramped than that of the Smart Keyboard. This is the one keyboard I tell almost everyone to steer clear from because the cons outweighs the pros ten to one.\nThe M&amp;M\nFinally, the Brydge Keyboard is a lot like the cheap M&amp;M knockoff in trail mix. It seems like the best option but it still tastes awful once you bite into it. I had high hopes for the Brydge Keyboard when it was first announced. It's only issue for me was that it had a Bluetooth connection, but I was willing to let that go for what it offered. The backlit keyboards and comfortable keyboard layout alongside a detachable clamshell design looks both functional and beautiful. Sadly, much like trail mix, the execution was lacking and it ended with a hunk of aluminum that barely worked properly. The keys were mushy and unresponsive in all 3 models I received when I order this keyboard. I have heard from people that you need to expect to send your keyboard back a few times before getting one that works properly, but to me that isn't acceptable in this ecosystem where a product that costs over $100 needs to be checked for quality and most likely sent back several times before a customer is satisfied. With that said, if you are willing to deal with that kind of hassle the Brydge Keyboard is worth a shot, the support team there is very nice and responsive, but you have been warned.\nMy Pick\nI am not sure what the answer to this is, but as of right now I am sticking with the Smart Keyboard because portability and connectivity are my two biggest needs in a keyboard for my iPad and nothing compares to the Smart Keyboard in these areas. I also am a fan of the butterfly key switches in the Smart Keyboard as I have gotten akin to the MacBrook Pro keyboard when I was using it. I am able to write without much incidents of mistakes and I have zero latency and missed keys when writing on it. So for now this is what I am using.\nWith that said if a new keyboard came into play for my 10.5\" iPad that executed on these areas and other things like a backlit keyboard and a better key layout I would happily spend my money on it. Sadly, I am not sure we will see anything new come to these iPads with the shadow of new iPads on the horizon, so I won't be holding my breath.\t\t\n",

      title: "Send To Things 3 - Drafts 5 Action",
      category: null,
      content: "\n\t\t\t\tI have been using Things 3 for a little while now as my main Task Manager, and I think this is sticking for me. I love being able to plan my days with their default sections, and the power it has in both organization and automation is something I cherish every time I use it.\nOne thing that I missed when I switched over the Things from Omnifocus 3 is the availability of project templates for Omnifocus. I had a ton of Taskpaper templates for common projects I would create. Things like podcast episodes, blog posts, and other regular projects were easy to create in Omnifocus with the tap of a button.\nThings 3 didn&rsquo;t have anything like that until they updated to version 3.4 allowing for x-callback-url schemes. This feature has been around for a bit now but I never got around to using it as a means to solve my problems with project templates. That is, until I came across the Drafts 5 action Send to Things.\nWhat it is\nSend to Things by user @eichtyler is something that solved my problems with project templates in Cultured Code&rsquo;s task manager. It made my life easy to just write out my lists and then make it the way I wanted.\nThe way it works is by using a custom syntax to differentiate items in your list from to-do items to deadlines, headings, etc. so when you are finally ready to send it over to Things 3 it is formatted the way you want.\nOne tool I loved in addition to this actions was the Send to Things Syntax action by Tim Nahumck. This allows you to tap on the action to prompt a pop-up showing you all the syntax built into the Send to Things action. It came in handy a number of times for me as I was getting acclimated to writing out my projects correctly. Here&rsquo;s what Nahumck&rsquo;s action shows when you open it:\nHere is the syntax for Send to Things:\n\n# New Project\n@ Existing Project\n&gt; Note\n#tag\n## Heading\n:when date/time\n!deadline\nTodo\n- checklist item\n\nThere are a number of items in here that I&rsquo;d like to go over with this to help you to understand the power of what you can do with this action.\nHow it Works\nLearning new syntax can be difficult and time consuming, but a large amount of these items are using Markdown syntax in a way where the script in this Drafts Action will parse out things based on the characters before it.\nOne impressive thing about this action is that depending on whether you want it in a project or just a list of items to your inbox you can differentiate that by whether or not you use a Project heading.\nI have broken it down into these two scenarios to help understand the differences.\nNew Project\nWhen you are wanting to either make a template or realize when making a list of actions to send to things that it is better off as a project all you need to do is make a Project header. This is just like a Heading in Markdown with a single &ldquo;#&rdquo; character followed by a space. Anything after that space is what the project name will be called. In this case I copied the template from the Drafts Action Directory so the project is called &ldquo;Project 1.&rdquo;\nYou may notice in the image that there is also a &ldquo;Project 2&rdquo; heading, which is exactly what you may think. If you use a new heading you are able to make another project and all the items below it will then be put in the second project as It is under the second heading.\nIf you want to add a note to the project that is a simple quote syntax in markdown with a &ldquo;&gt;&rdquo; character followed by a space. As you can see in the template if you make a new line with the syntax that new line carries over to the notes in the Project.\nWhen you want to use either a start date or a deadline the syntax on these aren&rsquo;t just simple symbols. These are arguably the most deviant from traditional Markdown syntax, making it a little more difficult to understand.\nIf you want to use a start date, meaning that until this date your project will be in the Upcoming area, you use the syntax &ldquo;:when&rdquo; followed by a space. From there you can use natural language input such as &ldquo;tomorrow&rdquo; in this template, making it much easier to differentiate when these items are taking place over the date picker. You can also use things like &ldquo;next Monday&rdquo; as well when writing your dates.\nThe same goes for the deadline, only the syntax necessary to make that work is &ldquo;!deadline&rdquo; followed by a space. Just input what ever date you want after that and the deadline will carry over when you send it to Things 3.\nFinally, if you want to add a task item you just need to make a new line and enter in the name of the task. There are no special characters or syntax necessary for task items. Which is the smart move as you can add syntax in later if you so choose, but the main point of this action is to quickly lay out the items you want to send to Things, and if you needed a special character or something to mark it as a task item your efficiency would drop dramatically. In this template you can see the task items named &ldquo;Todo 1&rdquo; &ldquo;Todo 2&rdquo; and so on.\nNow that you have your projects all set and ready to go you can now send it to Things via the Drafts action. This is what you get when you use the default template on the Drafts Action for sending as a new project.\nItems into Inbox\nIf you aren&rsquo;t looking to make a new project, and instead just want to send something to Things Inbox to organize later it is even easier.\nAs you can see the syntax used is the same, the only addition is comments for to-do items. As you can see in the template, they are solely for organizing your thoughts when writing them and will be ignored when you send it to Things. It is a great way to put everything in your mind on to the screen and figure it out once your head is emptied and you have everything laid out. It is also great if you plan to keep this note as a template for future items.\nYou will also see the absence of Project headings, which brings a good point that you can actually combine these two templates and have the items above the first project heading go to the Inbox and the rest go to their respective Projects. Once you have everything in there that you want sent to Things you are ready to run the action. This is what you will see with the default template on the Drafts Action for inbox items.\nProblems with it\nOne thing that I can not seem to get to work properly is the use of tags. I have tried existing tags and new tags in these templates but none of them seem to follow into Things. I am not sure if this is me doing something wrong or something that needs to change in the script. Either way, if you have a fix for this let me know either via email or on Twitter.\nAll in all this action has made things like projects, templates, and all around task management much easier for me. I love Things 3 and their addition to a Desktop-Class Productivity for iPad in version 3.6 has made inputting tasks easier than ever, but something about being able to input my task whilst writing in Drafts makes things really gel. I no longer have to switch modes, and instead just need to use this syntax in a new note and with a simple swipe and tap I can send it to Things 3 and continue with the work I was doing previous.\nThere is something to be said about not having to open a task management app every time you want to add something to it. It allows for you to stay focused on the task at hand and avoid being distracted with anything that may pop out at you in your task list.\nThis action allows for that and makes adding the important meta-data you want a cinch. Try this out today, and if you want something to help you remember the syntax get Nahumck&rsquo;s supplementary action as well. Additionally you can read his review of Drafts 5 on MacStories as well if you aren&rsquo;t sure what Drafts 5 is and what to learn more.\nGive these actions a shot and see if this can solve any of your problems with task management in Things 3, I know It did for me.\t\t\n",

      title: "Why Podcasting Should NOT Be Free",
      category: null,
      content: "\n\t\t\t\tNir Zicherman writing on Medium:\nFor almost every single podcast Anchor hosts, the cost to us is less than 10 cents per month. That means that hosting your podcast for an entire year costs Anchor around one dollar. If Anchor were to charge you $10 per month for file storage and basic analytics, we would either be grossly exaggerating our costs, or grossly overpaying our vendors.\nAnchor benefits greatly from economies of scale. The easier we make it for everyone to make podcasts, the closer to zero we can drive the average price of hosting everyone’s podcasts. Our per-user costs drop every time we reach a new growth milestone, and will continue to do so. This is because the incremental price of variable costs (like hosting) go down the more we host, and the static costs (like servers) are split as tiny fractions among the many podcasts on Anchor.\nPeople may ask “So if you’re not making money off of me to host… what’s your business model?” We are not in the business of charging you, the podcaster. We want to work with you to help you make money off your podcast, in which case we all win. And that 10 cents per month to host your podcast becomes a negligible cost compared to the revenue we can all earn together as we advance the medium of podcasting together.\nAnchor has long been on my radar as a podcasting platform, but their model isn’t what podcasting needs. Hosting costs isn’t the problem with podcasting. It is the fact that companies like Anchor, Sticher and Blog Talk Radio are taking the content that you publish, making it only accessible on their platform, and then pumping ads in it.\nI pay $12 a month on Simplecast for both Getting Caught Up and A Slab of Glass. I do it happily because I know that I am supporting developers with my money for hosting, a website, technical support, and download statistics that they share with me on how my shows are doing. I don’t have to hope and pray that Anchor makes their money with ads in order to keep my content alive.\nAnother point that gets me is the fact that they need a large base of active users to make their model work.\nManton Reece on Micro.blog:\nAnchor seems to be going for the YouTube model. They want a huge number of people to use their platform. But the concentration of so much media in one place is one of the problems with today’s web. Massive social networks like Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube have too much power over writers, photographers, and video creators. We do not want that for podcasts.\nMicro.blog podcast hosting isn’t free. It’s $10/month. But for that price you get not just a podcast feed but also a full hosted blog with support for microblog posts or longer essays, photo blogging, custom themes and CSS, posting from a bunch of third-party apps and our iOS microcasting app Wavelength, and most importantly everything at your own domain name so you own the content. The competition for Micro.blog isn’t Anchor; it’s Squarespace and WordPress.\nSome things are worth paying for. I share Nir’s goal that podcasting should be more accessible and more affordable to more people, but it’s dangerous to give one company too much control over podcasting. Anchor’s business model demands scale. It’s still unclear how that will play out.\nDemanding scale in your model is a lot like demanding a raise before you get offered a job. It isn’t practical and it’s actually really insulting to the users of your platform.\nI consume YouTube and even have a podcast co-host that posts on it regularly, but YouTubers will be the first to tell you that this model isn’t all that it is cracked up to be. There are issues, and when it is being run by one of the biggest companies in the world and still having problems, there is no doubt this “free to play” model isn’t perfect.\nWe need to start putting out money where our mouths are when it comes to the things we care about, and podcast hosting is one of them for me. I have tried tons of podcast hosting services and I have seen other “free” options come and go the last 7 years I have been doing this. the only ones that stick around are ones getting capital from their users instead of making them the product.\t\t\n",

It’s no surprise he has now made it into a Workflow.\nIf you aren’t sure what Hyper-Scheduling is, it’s blocking out time in a calendar as a means to plan out your day. Instead of making a task list and working around that, you instead block out time for the important projects on that list and stick to a plan. The difference is that the when is in tandem with the what.\nHow it Works\nDavid created a very nice video tutorial on how the Workflow is made, explaining  all the different things you can put in each event, and so on.\n\n\n\nYou can download the Workflow here if you don’t want to make one yourself.\nI am going to start giving Hyper-Scheduling a shot as I think it may help me keep on task more often and make things a little more structured.

      category: null,
      content: "\n\t\t\t\tUsing keyboard shortcuts on iOS allows you to fly through the tedious tasks of editing, formatting, and moving items to where you want them to be.\nSince I use the Smart Keyboard with my iPad a vast majority of the time I am working on it, keyboard shortcuts have been my bread and butter. To not use them means I have to tap on the screen to modify what it is I am working on. It adds friction to my work. Not being able to use the most efficient way of doing things on my devices can drive me up a wall, and I know I am not alone in this.\nWhich is why keyboard shortcuts can be so useful. Shortcuts isn’t a word that is arbitrary on this scenario, it really is a literal shortcut to get to your destination faster, and who doesn’t want that? But not all apps are created equal when it comes to shortcuts.\nWho Does Keyboard Shortcuts Right\nBefore I start to go over the things that needs work, I have to give credit where credit is due. That credit goes to the 3rd party developers that embrace those that are using a keyboard with their iPads and making it a staple in their workflows. I have two specific apps in mind, but they are by no means the only ones doing great work for the keyboard users on iOS.\nFerrite\n\nThe quintessential example of getting keyboard shortcuts right on iOS is that of Ferrite which I adore. Not only can do everything from a keyboard, but you can even assign each action to the key binding of your choosing.\n\nIn fact, Ferrite offers a lot of great presets for popular digital audio workstations (DAWs) for those that are familiar with them. For me, I have a custom key binding as I use an app that does not have presets built into Ferrite called Hindenburg.\nThings 3\n\nCultured Code came out with Things 3 a while back, and I wasn’t happy with the space keyboard shortcuts when it shipped, but that all changed when they released version 3.6 in May. That update offered what they consider “Desktop-Class Productivity”. Nearly everything can be on with just the keyboard on the iPad app of Things.\nThis was when I finally felt like Things 3 was now ready to ship, and I began to use it as my task manager of choice from there on. One thing I want to note though is that Things only shows the keyboard actions you can do in the current situation you are in so you won’t see the plethora of keyboard shortcuts in the pop up box when you hold the Command key. If you want to see all of the shortcuts available Cultured Code has a great list on their blog.\nProblems With iOS Keyboard Shortcuts\nSome apps provide a vast array of commands and shortcuts to allow iPad users to use their keyboard 100% of the time. Others though, they don’t think much of the keyboard users. Which brings me to the first speed bump in iOS for keyboard users: you are at the mercy of developers to provide the shortcuts you need.\nDevelopers Have to Do All The Heavy Lifting\nThis is not to condemn developers for this problem, many developers often have plans to integrate shortcuts in their apps in the future. The only problem is time and resources. Many of my favorite apps. like Drafts 5 for example, are developed solely by one person and they can’t always get to secondary things like shortcuts immediately after launch. They have other things to worry about like making sure the app doesn’t crash regularly and the features that people want the most is what goes to the topi of the to-do list. Which makes things like keyboard shortcuts fall lower and lower on the list of priorities.\nBut this isn’t just a developer issue, this is also an issue that Apple can help in with their iOS operating system as a whole.\nLack of Apple Subtleties\nFor instance, it can be hard to tell which app is currently connected to the keyboard.\nAnother perfect example: keyboard shortcuts. https://t.co/2s6kC21tcS\n&mdash; John Gruber (@gruber) April 22, 2018\nWhen you work in split view it can be hard to tell which app has the keyboard connected to it, there is no kind of indication outside of a blinking cursor if you are using a text editor that supports that.\nOne thing I have noticed that helps is if you quickly tap on the app you want to use the keyboard with. This isn’t ideal, but it is the best option I have found that works with iOS 11 as of now (and the iOS 12 beta as well).\nA simple indication of what app is currently active could solve this problem easily, and I think iOS needs this in their software.\nFinal Thoughts\nThe keyboard for iOS isn’t perfect, but if you implement more keyboard shortcuts it can help you do your work even a little bit better. One thing I tell all of the people I know who are using an iPad with a keyboard is to press and hold the Command key in the apps they use, because it will show all of the keyboard shortcuts you can do.\nIn the future I would love Apple to really make it clear that you can do all of the things you want from a MacBook in an iPad, including keyboard shortcuts. If Apple embraces the fact that this touch device is also a true laptop replacement, they need to start with they keyboard and the software behind it.\nIn a perfect world Apple would make everything possible on an iPad also an option on the keyboard. Until then though, I will just have to contact the developers, who work so hard on these apps, and ask them politely to embrace the keyboard like so many of us have.\nIf you are looking for other keyboard shortcuts, check out Apple’s documentation online and see some of the things you can do on iOS with a keyboard.\t\t\n",

      content: "\n\t\t\t\tBradley Chambers writing for 9To5Mac:\n\n  June 28th, 2005 might go down as one of the biggest days in the history of media. It was the day Apple announced they were taking podcasting mainstream by including support for Podcasts in iTunes 4.9 and with syncing to the iPod. As rumors continue to swirl of iTunes being dismantled on macOS (in favor of dedicated apps), I thought it might be fun to take a look back at this important decision.\n\n    Apple® today announced it is taking Podcasting mainstream by building everything users need to discover, subscribe, manage and listen to Podcasts right into iTunes® 4.9, the latest version of its award winning digital music software and online music store. iTunes users can now easily subscribe to over 3,000 free Podcasts and have each new episode automatically delivered over the Internet to their computer and iPod®.\n    “Apple is taking Podcasting mainstream by building it right into iTunes,” said Steve Jobs, Apple’s CEO. “Podcasting is the next generation of radio, and users can now subscribe to over 3,000 free Podcasts and have each new episode automatically delivered over the Internet to their computer and iPod.”\n    The new Podcast Directory in iTunes 4.9 features over 3,000 free audio programs, making it one of the largest Podcast directories in the world, with favorites such as ABC News, Adam Curry, BBC, Clear Channel, The Dawn and Drew Show, Disney, Engadget, ESPN, Newsweek and NPR member stations such as KCRW in Los Angeles and WGBH in Boston.\n  \n  For podcast fans that have only ever used iPhone apps to download podcasts, you have no idea the lengths we used to go to get our shows. This was also at a time when only a small percentage of homes in the US had broadband (so downloading shows could be time-consuming).\n\nPodcasting wasn't in my life until 2007, but I don't think it would have ever been a part of my life if not for Apple doing this. It has become a staple to every aspect of my interests. News, technology, politics, comedy, and everything in between comes from podcasts first and elsewhere a distant second. It is the first thing I listen to after waking up, the only thing I listen to when in the car, and what I listen to when I am in the mood of taking a break from work I am doing (even sometimes during work).\nI care deeply about this medium and have for over a decade. I want it to thrive, I want it to continue to be a means for people to express themselves online without having gatekeepers. Apple has made that a possibility because they didn't make it a place to host podcasts but rather a means to distribute. I still think this was the best call for Apple. Allowing people to own their content in what ever way they want and to then hook it into this directory allows for people to not have to worry about playing in someone else's backyard.\nApple gave podcasting a platform 13 years ago and kick-started its growth, and for that I couldn't be more grateful.\t\t\n",

The other is a pretty great idea that I can’t share until I figure out how exactly I’m going to implement it.

You can find an example of one I used recently to get an idea of what I am talking about.\nHow it Works\nSo with Workflow, you can use the Share Sheet as a means to run a Workflow and take things like a URL from Safari, your clipboard, and selected text into the workflow to use within it. All three of these examples are used with the Workflow I have created after taking a look at what both Evan and Christopher have done.\n\nFirst, you need to find the post you want to link in Safari on your iPhone or iPad. From there you select the text you want to use in the post as a quote. With that text selected, open up the share sheet and run the Link Post Workflow.\n\nAs the Workflow Opens up there will be two questions that it will ask you. The first question being what the publication is. In this case it is 40tech. After that it will ask for the author’s name, which is Evan Kline.\nOnce both the publication and the author is determined the workflow will then take the URL of the website you shared and the selected text you highlighted to make it into a Markdown ready post.\n\nOnce all of the text formatting is done a new Ulysses sheet will be made with the entire link post formatted and linked properly. All that is left now is to write your own response to the link post!\nYou can download the workflow here and make any changes you need to it. Happy posting!\t\t\n",

Christopher Clark: “That’s My Mantra: Just Get to Work”:\n\nHow do you manage to find the time for writing, in addition to your bread-and-butter job?\nIt’s hard. I used to carve out a couple of hours per morning or evening. But I have kids now, too. And I made a promise to myself to put family first, so sometimes the writing time disappears in order to help my kids with their homework or their own creative endeavors. But when I do decide to put my butt in the seat to write, I am fiercely protective of that time. I think Stephen King said in On Writing that he doesn’t write every day of every week of his life, but that when he is writing he writes every day. That’s what I strive towards.\nWhat, do you think, is most important for an author: Jeff Perry talent, craft, or diligence?\nDiligence. We’re all born with some degree of talent, which we nurture by reading a lot and writing a lot. Craft is something you pick up along the way, again by reading and writing a lot. But there’s no getting around the fact that diligence is the most important factor. You have to want it. You have to want it bad, and work at it (in at least some small way) all of the time.\n\nUlysses isn&#8217;t only a great app, but it is also a really well done blog for creatives to draw inspiration from. The questions they ask aren&#8217;t just cookie-cutter questions and I am impressed with the answers they get from their interviewees.\nI also love how Christopher Clark explains the importance of diligence. It really validates my reasoning for writing every day on Tablet Habit, and also lights a fire under me.\t\t\n",

When the iPhone was announced, I believed that if Apple did what they said they were going to, then it would be a breakthrough product that upended the technology world. But the software was the missing piece of the puzzle.\nSo when the iPhone OS (as it was known then) SDK became available, I handed in my notice. A couple of weeks later I left, downloaded the SDK, and turned Wooji Juice (my personal blog of occasional ramblings about tech and stuff) into Wooji Juice (my iOS app business). And ten years and a dozen or so apps later, here we are.\nCanis is one of those developers that you just want to get to know on a personal level. I didn&#8217;t get to know him until I started to look into Ferrite but in the podcasts he has been on and interviews he has done, it is clear that he not only cares immensely about his users but also wants to make sure that his apps are polished and perfect. I am glad he put everything into the apps he made, because I wouldn&#8217;t be able to podcast on an iPad without his hard work.\t\t\n",

I don’t typically like to dwell on anniversaries, but a decade of App Store is a big deal; I felt like both MacStories and AppStories were uniquely suited not just to nostalgically commemorate the App Store’s humble beginnings, but to tell the stories of the people whose lives were changed by it over the past 10 years. I wanted to involve the entire MacStories team in this project, and I wanted to reach out to developers who were there in the early days of the App Store as well as those who started making apps in recent years. And I wanted this special event to be at the intersection of longform articles and in-depth podcast conversations, with a healthy mix of stories about the history of the Store, a celebration of its accomplishments, and a critical look at its past missteps and potential for future changes. So, sometime in January, we began planning all of this, and we got to work.\nThe result, which I’m incredibly happy to announce today, is our App Store at 10 event. Starting today for an entire week, we’re going to publish 1–2 feature stories on the site each day, which will be aggregated at this event hub page. Additionally, there will be one special AppStories episode each day for a total of six interview episodes by the end of the week.\nIf there is any site that should be covering the App Store’s 10th anniversary it is MacStories. Federico Viticci and his team have done amazing work over the years covering apps and indie developers. Not to mention the longform research projects that are incomparable to anything else out there. I can’t wait to see what comes from them in the coming days.\nCongratulations MacStories, here’s to another 10 years.\t\t\n",

I could go into the reasons why, but I want to talk more about what this means for Tablet Habit. In a recent episode of A Slab of Glass I talked about the possibility of moving the website away from Tablet Habit and into something a little less specific.\n\nThankfully, Mike Rapin and Christopher Lawley talked me off this branding ledge.If you haven't listened to this episode I really recommend you do! We dive deep into my issue, but also talk more broadly about things like imposter syndrome and the importance of consistency; which brings me to my next announcement.\n\nI plan to write on Tablet Habit daily every Monday through Friday starting this upcoming Monday July 9th. This has been something I have been wanting to do for a while and when I saw that I have been writing on here for over 6 months (it will be a year in October) I knew I wanted to step up my writing and make more consistent content. This venture wasn't something I thought I would love so much, I mainly did it to take a break from podcasting, but this has been a lot of fun and very exciting to do for the better part of a year. Blogging is something that I think is in my DNA.\n\nI love to share content and write about the things I am passionate about, but seeing people read my work and go out of their way to reach out to me on Twitter has been humbling and exhilarating.\n\nThe future of Tablet Habit may not be just about iPads, but it really never was. It was a place for me to share my thoughts on Apple, iOS, productivity, and now macOS as well. These are things I am passionate about and something that I see myself doing regularly for a long time. So while Tablet Habit isn't an iPad only blog like I intended when I started, I think this change in the narrative is something that is not only going to bring more value to you, but also something that is more fulfilling for me.\n\nI thank you for reading and I hope this change is something that you are as excited about as me. If you have anything you want to talk to me about feel free to leave a comment below, find me on Twitter, or shoot me an email. Until then, I will see you all Monday!\t\t\n",

But when I was at WWDC, I saw someone go to share a bit of text and he… just…swiped on the list of actions\n&nbsp;\nAfter you select some text, have you ever tried to tap on that tiny little arrow on your phone to go to more options? I bet you’ve missed pressing it on more than one occasion. But thanks to Matthew Cassinelli your days of fumbling through the tiny text options are over\nI have been on iOS for years and have never known about this little trick. It is almost as good as the precise cursor selection that iOS implemented not too long ago. It is like having the weights on your feet taken off before a run. Give it a try if you get a chance. One thing Matt recommends is to use it in Drafts and Workflow.\nFor anyone who uses the Workflow action extension often and likes to run workflows on text using the text selection share menu, this is extremely handy. And for Drafts users, this also provides quicker access to the Dictate and Arrange actions available in that second page of the copy &amp; paste menu.\nSo if you haven't already, give this neat trick a shot and let me know what you think on Twitter.\t\t\n",

I did an experiment using the Mac exclusively for a week, and I didn’t hate it. In fact I found that a lot of the things I was doing on the iPad could be done in either less time or less hassle than on an Mac. It was a surprising twist, but I decided to stick with the iPad to stay “on brand.”\nThis was a mistake.\nI put the device first and the work second. I wanted to be an iPad only person so bad that I sacrificed some productivity and efficiency to stay “on brand.” I felt like this was only an iPad blog and if I went away from that I would be doing everyone a disservice. Except now that I knew the Mac was something that I could use to get work done there was this voice in my head telling me to go back to it for some things.\nI began to feel like a fraud, a trickster, and a liar to the people who decided to read my blog regularly as an iPad user. But I knew that the Mac was something that I wanted to have in my life. It made me happy when working on the things that mattered to me.\nSo I made a purchase.\n&nbsp;\n\nYeah…big day. pic.twitter.com/9jAmUiPgZK\n— Jeff Perry (@iamjeffperry) June 29, 2018\nSo, I bought a new MacBook Pro. I know that some people may think that I made a bad decision not waiting until September to see if new Macs come out, but I am happy with my purchase and I feel that this Mac will get me by the next several years without issue.\nI loved this computer the minute I took it out of the plastic and cracked it open. The keyboard is actually really enjoyable, the Space Gray color is beautiful, and the power this computer has is incredible. I love my Mac, and I know that I made the right decision getting one.\n\nI….. I think I’m a Mac person now.\n— Jeff Perry (@iamjeffperry) June 29, 2018\n\njeff\n— plus ultra mike (@mikerapin) June 29, 2018\nMy co-host to Getting Caught Up, Mike Rapin, chimed in on my purchase. To you give you some background, I am notorious for starting new projects or jumping the gun on things and this was something I mentioned to Mike earlier in that week. I knew I was going to be getting this computer I just didn’t tell him.\nChristopher Lawley, my co-host for A Slab of Glass, also knows of my woes with the iPad and me wanting to do more on my Mac. In the conversations we had I also expressed my interest in changing the name of the blog to something other than Tablet Habit, but clearly they felt that that was a bad idea.\nThe two of them, who I call my friends, wanted to make sure that I didn’t do anything stupid like changing the name of my website again. They knew that I felt like an imposter using a Mac and writing on a website called Tablet Habit. It was like having a Star Trek blog and writing about how Star Wars is a great series as well. But it wasn’t just those two who felt that I shouldn’t change the name.\n\nHaving a blog about the iPad written by someone using a Mac more and more doesn’t make sense. It’s like having a blog about the iPhone while using an android.\n— Jeff Perry (@iamjeffperry) June 29, 2018\n\nThere’s some precedent here - MacStories is mostly iOS these days.\n— Evan Kline (@40tech) June 30, 2018\nBut when your friends are persistent on making sure you don’t do something silly they make it known.\n\nI think we need to have a crossover episode/intervention.\nNo Jeff you don’t need to move your website. 😂😜😂\n— Christopher Lawley (@chris_lawley) June 29, 2018\n&nbsp;\n\nOH BOY. CAN WE???\n— plus ultra mike (@mikerapin) June 30, 2018\n\nI’m so in! Name the time and Skype call!\n— Christopher Lawley (@chris_lawley) June 30, 2018\nSo we sat down and spent almost an hour recording a special episode together where both Christopher and Mike tell me why they feel so strongly on me maintaining the name of Tablet Habit and what I should do next.\nSo, to avoid spoiling it for you, I will refrain from posting the second part of this journey until after it is posted on Thursday.\nI will say Tablet Habit isn’t about the tools I use. It used to be, but it isn't anymore. It is about something much bigger than what tools I use to get my work done. It is about the work itself.\nYou see, blogging has always been a narrative format to me, and this is just part of my narrative. Tablet Habit was originally meant to be about the iPad, how I use it and how others can use it as their main device, but that changed over time. It became less about the devices and more about what you can do on those devices. It was less about tools, and more about results.\nUntil then, I can’t wait to show you what we have in store for you all. I am so excited to share this podcast with you all in a couple of days!\t\t\n",

Currently, none of the major browsers appears to do so.\nIt’s time to push back against this and demand first-class support for RSS as part of the move to re-decentralise the Web.\nBut you don’t have to wait for browser vendors (some of which – like Google – are surveillance capitalists themselves, and others, like Mozilla, get all their money from surveillance capitalists). You can start making RSS more visible again today by finding the URL for your own RSS feed and exposing it visibly on your site.\n\nI love how so many people are pushing to have RSS available and accessible for their favorite sites. It is something I have been saying to myself for years. While I wouldn’t call this a resurgence, I certainly am happy to see a small percentage of people on the web show they care about things like this.\nWhich is why I wanted to remind everyone that they can subscribe to my RSS feed and get access to all of my content in their favorite RSS readers.

Then I got to thinking about all my tasks that have a long list of sub tasks, like my grocery list. So with that I decided to give this workflow a whirl because I have been wanting to make Bear a more useful app for me.\n\nThis workflow is incredibly simple, but it works for me to get a task in Things as quickly as possible and then use that x-callback-URL to then get into Bear to expand on my new note/list.\nHow it Works\nAfter running the workflow and making a title for the note, it creates a Bear note with the given input I wrote down in Workflow. Afterwards I am presented with the new task in Things 3 and I can open the note directly thanks to the automated link created in the task's note. From there I am ready to start listing all of my needed groceries.\nSo now, instead of a list of every single thing I need at the grocery store clogging up my task manager, I now only have a link of the Bear note where I can switch modes in my brain and start to focus on the task at hand, rather than the tasks I need to handle.\nI plan to play around with this a bit more and see if there is anything I can do to make this workflow even more powerful for things like blog posts and podcast show notes.\nIf you want to see some other amazing automation tools you can use to make Bear an even more powerful notes app you can do so on Bear's blog.\t\t\n",

      title: "How I Handle Stress and Overwhelm",
      category: null,
      content: "\n\t\t\t\tA friend of mine recently took a new job, and in a message to me said that they were worried about not liking the new position. Their reasoning wasn't something that I would consider \"normal\" like the management sucks, the pay isn't great, or their coworkers sucked. This was something more personal.\nThe reason they gave was because they were stressed and felt overwhelmed every single day at their new job. This got me thinking about those two words. \"Stress\" and \"Overwhelm\" are two very different words if you ask me.\nTo me, being stressed is the pressure you feel when you have a lot on your plate, it is when you are in the \"busy season\" of your annual work year. Being overwhelmed is when you have that kind of stress and then can't find a way to make it all work.\nI know that the idea of stress being anything other than negative sounds odd, but for me it is a means to push myself. My experience with stress and overwhelm isn't something new. I have been working in television since I was in high school in some form, and if you ask me that is one of the more stressful jobs you can have. Every single job I have had in television, whether it was in high school, college (both unpaid and volunteered), or professionally, I have encountered these feelings. I felt this waterfall of stress wash over me like a hurricane. I worried it was too much for me to handle.\nFor those of you who don't work in a high-stress environments like TV news, it can be a hellstorm that never ends. Deadlines need to be hit, things need to be working properly (there are a ton of technical pieces between recording the video on a camera and then broadcasting it over the air), and you have to know what to do before it even happens. Broadcasting isn't for everyone, but I know these kinds of environments is where I thrive. I have known it for the better part of a decade.\nHigh-stress, time-sensitive environments makes me feel at home. It is something that I not only thrive in, but is normal for me. Which can be a gift and a curse at the same time. Working in environments where at the end of each day you can't believe you managed to get things to go as well as they did, the mundane can be agonizing. My fiancé, who has been with me for over 6 years, knows the naked fact that I don't know how to relax.\nI don't know what came first, my love for high-stress working environments, or my inability to deal with downtime. For instance, when I am spending time with her, or just with our friends in general, she know the gears in my head are always turning.\n\n  \"What could I be doing for my work that I am not doing right now?\"\n  \"Should I start this new project?\"\n  \"What about that thing I got in my email? I really need to get back to the guy who emailed me about that one thing.\"\n\nThis has zero to do with the company I am with, I love all my friends and family, and I want to be present with them. But that isn't always possible with me. It feels as if my wiring is a bit off because I prefer to be working on things alone in a room with a keyboard and iPad over relaxing and putting my feet up after my full-time job. Even if there is a little bit of gas left in me, I have to keep going until I hit empty.\nI am what some people call a \"workaholic\". Now, I know that I need to work on this, but I also know that I love all the projects and work I do outside of my full-time job. I love having two podcasts, a blog, a weekly email newsletter, and a slack channel that people can connect with me on 24/7. All of these things make me happy, and the culmination of them all gives me that sense of high-stress I thrive in.\nBut this is all about stress, not overwhelm. I rarely felt overwhelm in the multitude of tasks and projects I had to do at work and on the side. The bottom never fell out from under me when I was handling all these things.\nI wasn't always like this though, in fact I was a person that was very hard to motivate to do anything. I was always creative, but I never sought to pursue my creative ideas into something tangible. I was overwhelmed.\nInstead of working on things that I could do, I would sit around and make lists of dreams I had, goals I wanted to accomplish, and ideas for creative projects. I was just creating this long list of things I either couldn't, or didn't want to pursue. I couldn't because I either didn't have people willing to work with me on it, or I didn't want to because that involved a lot of work. Work I didn't know was possible from me. The list grew as if it had Giantism. This list haunted me for quite some time as a quiet nagging thought that always itched, but could never be scratched. Eventually that list became the size of a short novel.\nWith all these dreams and goals I had, I eventually began to realize all the small things I could be doing but that I'm not doing. This list of things I am not doing became my true source of overwhelm. It was a list hanging over me like a boulder 20 stories above me wrapped in twine, ready to break any second. I had the grandiose ideas to make films, write a book, finish a movie script, and create something beloved by all. If only I was good enough. If only I had what it takes. I shouldn't even bother trying, I will only hate it. This was my feedback loop, and it was the source of my overwhelm and stress simultaneously.\nThis is what some call Imposter Syndrome, and it is a hell of a thing to deal with. You feel you are just at the cusp of being \"found out,\" that your talents are all lies, and no matter what people say they are just being nice and not actually meaning it. It is like having the ability to accomplish anything you want, but you quit before you even start. Imposter Syndrome is a term I use all too often, and something I constantly battle with, but when I finally get something past that gate it becomes the only thing I think about.\nInspiration comes to me from many places, much like you I assume. Whether it is a podcast, TV show, movie, or even something organic that comes to my head, if that something gets started in any minor way there's nothing to get in my way.\nI think this has a lot to do with the workaholic mentality I have, I get a project and I immediately begin working on it. I outline my goals, I write out my plans and I start working on some minor things. Next thing I know it has been 5 hours and I haven't eaten anything all day. Rinse and repeat.\nThat is when my feedback loops come in:\n\n  \"Geez, I have a lot on my plate with this new project, I think I should probably slow down.\"\n  \"But if I slow down I won't get it done.\"\n  \"But if I don't I am going to get burnt out, I really should stop.\"\n  \"Jeff, you're so close to getting this part done, just get through this part and take a break.\"\n  \"Oh man, that part is awesome, I really see how this will incorporate with this other part I still need to work on.\"\n  \"Let's just get this part done.\"\n  \"Man, I really need to slow down I have a lot on my plate.\"\n\nRinse and repeat.\nEventually this gave me that stress I was talking about earlier. it becomes the drive I need to keep going, but this is a double-edged sword. The more stress I get the more work I want to get done, but the more work I have to do the more stressed I get. It was a balancing act to keep myself driven with high-stress environments but not too stressed to where I get overwhelmed and then give up. I needed that sweet spot.\nI am like a dog that has a machine to throw the ball every time I put it in the bucket. I keep going and going until I am physically and mentally exhausted. It's unhealthy, but I am yet to find something that is a good alternative for me.\nEventually I do get a moment of clarity and decide to take a break and make this work part of my routine rather than trying to sprint through an entire marathon. That is when I start planning out the rest of this project, bit by bit and line by line.\nEvery small task is added to the list, some get sub-tasks, and I eventually spit out a 100+ task list that I immediately get overwhelmed about. I am getting that waterfall of overwhelmedness again and I don't think I can keep going with the project.\nAt this point, after everything I have done, I make a decision to either kill this project and do it another time (aka never) or I persevere and press onward because that is what I should do. What do I do to determine what projects to keep or kill? Whatever makes me excited even when I am not working on it. That is what I want in something I work on, consistent delight and excitement.\nIf there is something that I am working on that I feel has lost its luster, I always have the thought of killing the project to work on something new. This has burned me before, with constant changes every few months because I \"lost interest.\" With that, I always tell myself that one day I will find that thing that makes me feel like nothing is work, but I am coming to realize that isn't something that happens often.\nEven writing for Tablet Habit has felt like \"work\" in some instances, and I would be lying if I said that I haven't thought about killing this blog to make time for something new. But when I have those thoughts, something that I rarely do with my other projects happens. I think about the things that I love about this and how many things I have gained from this. The pros outweighs the cons tenfold and that is what I need to light a fire under me and continue to make things worthwhile.\nSo, what does this mean for me going forward? I have learned how to make sure that I am working on things that I love, and kill the things I don't, but not without a serious look at the pros and cons of the things I do in the projects I consider killing. If I didn't do that I would just be a conveyor belt of projects that start with a a fiery flame but fizzle out spectacularly.\nBut I started talking about stress and overwhelm, so let me circle back on that in relation to the projects I work on. The projects I work on can be stressful at times, but as I said before I thrive in that kind of environment. I am able to make that stress something that pushes me to do bigger and better things than I have before.\nHowever, when I no longer feel that delight, or excitement I look at all of these things causing me stress and no longer use it as a means to push myself. It flips on me and becomes a source of overwhelm. This is when the things that I am working on becomes \"work\" and no longer becomes fun.\nFor me, I can't keep killing projects as soon at the going gets tough, I have done that for too long and, frankly, I am tired of it. So, when I think about ending something that I have invested a lot of my time and energy on I no longer hastily halt all operations. Instead, I plan to really look over the pros and cons of those projects and make my decision then.\nWhether this will work or not is still to be decided but I will say that I feel that I am on a better foundation than I was before I started thinking about this after my friend came to me for advice. So if you feel stress, use it. If you feel overwhelm, look into what is the root of this is and use that to make a decision on what should happen about it.\t\t\n",

For so long Apple showed no interest in automation, and I'd convinced myself that they were afraid to get that geeky all over their new mobile operating system. I'm not alone in this. However, with the Workflow acquisition, it feels like we have now embedded, inside Apple, a group of our brother and sister automation nerds and they are running wild all over the iOS operating system. I couldn't be happier. I hope that when iOS 12 ships, Siri Shortcuts delivers the goods we've seen so far. I also hope Apple management never wises up to the automation revolution that may result.\n\nSiri Shortcuts seems to really be Workflow 2.0. It doesn't seem to have been dumbed down in any way, and for that I am beyond thankful someone at Apple stuck to their guns and allowed the iPhone and iPad continue to have the power it gained with Workflow and beyond.\t\t\n",

New gestures that debuted in the iPhone X, released late last year, included swiping up from the gesture bar to get to the lock screen, and swiping up again to reach the home screen.\n  In order to get to the switcher, users can also swipe up from the gesture bar and pause. In addition, swiping down from anywhere on screen will open the app that's in the center.\n\nI have mixed feelings on this, but I think it makes sense given this:\n\n  The iPad adopting iPhone X-like gestures may indicate that the the next generation of iPads could be subtracting the home button as well.\n\nOn top of the gestures, there have been leaked images showing that the iOS 12 beta for the iPad does indeed have a Face ID menu in the settings\n[twitter.com/_inside/s...](https://twitter.com/_inside/status/1003859761010499584)\nSo look out everyone, new iPads that are more like the iPhone X are coming.\t\t\n",

      content: "\n\t\t\t\tWith WWDC Keynote now done and the sessions beginning, I think it's time to start talking about the features that Apple has presented to us in the last 48 hours. Namely Siri Shortcuts.\nThis, to me, was by far the most exciting announcement in all of the keynote. Workflow lives on, and it is now built into the OS. The screenshots and the look of the app is very similar to that of Workflow.\nBefore I get into what I think, a bit of a history lesson is important to note. Workflow has long been a beloved app to power users of iOS and without it the iPad doesn't feel like an honest-to-god replacement for the Mac. Workflow has become a pillar for iOS users to lean on when they hit a wall due to limitations in sand boxing.\nWorkflow is the bridge between the apps we love and allows for some powerful and interesting ways to get our work done. Without Workflow, I would probably still have an iPad as my main device but it wouldn't be nearly as effective. It would be a chore to move things from one app to another, and this is why this one app is so important. It is also why when the announcement was made that this app would be acquired by Apple, along with its team, we all started to worry.\nWe have seen things like this happen before. A big company buys a team of very talented developers to join them, then the app is \"sunset.\" This has happened to things like email clients and other app that are a dime a dozen. But workflow is one of a kind. It is a unicorn of a tool that, if removed, would shatter a lot of people's day-to-day operations. Especially mine.\nWorkflow has since been updated since the acquisition, and that allowed us power users to breathe. But when Siri Shortcuts was announced, a lot of people, including myself, got worried again about the future of Workflow.\nThere are a lot of questions still to be answered. Siri Shortcuts isn't even on the iOS 12 beta as of now. But I have a list of questions I want answered before I can ease off on my apprehensive attitude on this new addition to iOS.\n1.) Is this app going to replace Workflow, or will it just be an addition?\n2.) If this is replacing Workflow, will I be able to import my current workflows without sacrifice?\n3.) How powerful will this app be for automation?\n4.) Can I trigger this without Siri? For instance, as an action in the Share Sheet?\n5.) Is there a limitation on how many actions happen in a single workflow?\n6.) There seems to be some kind of scripting possible with Siri Shortcuts, but what kinds of scripting is available?\nI failed to watch the live stream of the WWDC session on Siri Shortcuts last night due to work, so if you know the answers to these questions, feel free to let me know on Twitter.\nSiri Shortcuts is still an exciting feature for me. However, until we learn more I will contain my excitement for now. I just worry that this might be a \"two steps back, one step forward\" kind of change for iOS.\nSo I beg of you Apple, please know you are dealing with a delicate tool that could break a lot of our, well, workflows.\t\t\n",

      title: "My Hopes for WWDC",
      category: null,
      content: "\n\t\t\t\tWith WWDC just around the corner I wanted to talk about some of the things I hope to see. With that said, I am not necessarily expecting to see any of these things. Some of them are wild and probably not going to happen, but I can hope right?\nHonestly my expectations for this WWDC is very low because I don't foresee anything coming from this years keynote that will blow me away, and that's okay. With low expectations I can be easily surprised and delighted, and I also think that for Apple to continue improving iOS, the Mac, and their software they could use a buffer to make sure their foundation of current apps, hardware, and software are up to snuff.\nHowever, I do have a list of things I want to come in WWDC.\nBetter Notifications\nThe current climate for notifications for me is abysmal. I never use the Notification Center or really anything other than badges and a few banner notifications. I rarely have anything pop up, and it is all because it doesn't make things easy for the user. When I have Twitter notifications on, for instance, when someone tweets it removes all of them as soon as I open the app. So if I get a few notifications when people I want to see tweet, I open the official Twitter client. Then all of those other notifications, including the ones I never tapped on, are no longer in my list. So I end up having to either keep a mental list in my head of all the people who were in my notifications or, more likely, decide which one seems the most interesting and dismiss all the rest. This frustrating experience leaves a bad taste in my mouth and this incessant need to immediately tap on any new notifications I get because I fear if I don't I won't be able to later once I get more down the pipe.\nThis isn't an intuitive system and I would rather have these notifications be more granular with the abilities it can do. Things like grouping by app, selecting more specific functions of what notifications I can get, and how they are removed. These are all things I desperately want to see Apple implement come iOS 12.\nDefault Apps\nThis has been on my list for a long time and I think it is time with iOS to allow for people to decide things like their default mail app, browser, and default task manager. Instead of having to either deal with the extra taps every time you want to share something, or conform to the stock Mail app as I have. I want people to be free from these chains and use whatever app they want.\nI want people to be able to tap on a button like \"Open in Browser\" and have that link open in iCab Mobile or Chrome for iOS. I hate having to take the extra unnecessary steps to use the share sheet and scroll to iCab Mobile every time I want to open a link. It doesn't seem like much once in a while but if it is a default app those few taps add up exponentially.\nNew Smart Keyboard\nIt is time to make the Smart Keyboard a Pro keyboard.\nI love the practicality and portability of the Smart Keyboard but I think it is missing a few things that are needed for Pro users. Things like backlit keys, or an added function row come to mind when I think of the things I want improved with the keyboard.\nIn a perfect world I would also like Apple to use key switches like that on the Magic Keyboard. Both the current Mac butterfly switches and whatever switches are in the Smart Keyboard don't provide enough travel to my liking and I think most Keyboard enthusiasts will agree that key travel is one of those things that, if not done right, is a deal breaker.\nMore Keyboard Friendly shortcuts in iOS\nIf Appel doesn't make a better keyboard, I would at least like to have better shortcuts. Things like multi-tasking is still touch-only. This was something CGP Grey brought up in the iOS 11 betas where you can use spotlight, search for an app and when highlighted you can use a shortcut like Shift+Command+→ to move that app in the right position of split screen. The same could be done for the left side, and if you want it full screen just use the down arrow.\nAn app like Things 3 touts the ability to make their application \"Desktop-Class\" and allows for nearly everything to be done in that iOS application right from a keyboard. No more zombie-arm when you have to reach out and interact with the screen anymore. Instead, you have the ability to do everything right from a keyboard. This is what I want with iOS. I want Apple to really make the iPad Pro a piece of hardware where professionals can take this with the instead of a laptop without compromise, and until a keyboard-only ecosystem is embraced I don't think that can be done.\nBetter Audio Functionality for Podcasting on iOS\nI have spoken about podcasting on the iPad before. While it is possible to record and edit a podcast on iOS, you need two devices to do it. I would love Apple to go all-in on podcasting on iOS and make it possible for developers to easily allow for both a Skype or FaceTime call to be in progress and use an audio interface to record the mic plugged in to the iPad. If I am able to record a podcast with only an iPad I would find myself on the \"Best I love you\" side of happiness from the Ticci Leak Scale.\nMore Automation in iOS\nIt has been a little over a year since Apple acquired Workflow and the staff behind this automation app. Outside of a few updates, which are pleasant surprises, there hasn't been much else to indicate what Apple is doing with either Workflow or that team. I would like to see something to point towards automation on the iPad to know that Apple is making good on their acquisition and allowing that amazing team continue to push the platform forward and make iOS an even more powerful system.\nIn a perfect world I would like to see automation baked into iOS 12 and allow for people who want more automation be able to do so in a simple and powerful way. More than likely though it will be a slow roll for automation to come to the iPad and iOS, chipping away bit by bit to get automation for iOS to be less nerdy and complicated.\nConclusion\nWWDC is set to have their keynote Monday, June 4th, at 10am PT (1pm ET). Most of the speculation is for it to be a snooze but I am looking forward to an event that has no leaks. It's like going into a critically acclaimed movie without having heard a hint of spoilers. It is exciting and nerve-racking at the same time.\nI plan to record an episode of A Slab of Glass with Christopher Lawley shortly after the keynote is over and will have it posted a few hours afterwards for you all to hear.\nI also plan to write a few things about iOS 12 and anything else that seems interesting here. So make sure you add this to your RSS feeds so you don't miss a thing!\t\t\n",

I have been going all-in with Drafts 5 and one thing I absolutely love is the ability to make Drafts whatever kind of app you want.\nIt can be a Task management app, like this workflow shows, or a writing app as I have been using it recently. The versatility and power this app can’t be overstated enough.

      title: "Uncanny Valley and the iPad",
      category: null,
      content: "\n\t\t\t\tThe iPad is a great machine and has come a long way over the past 10 years. With that said, there are still some things that people who are long-time Mac users will stick their nose up at. Things like advanced multi-tasking and Sandboxing have long been issues Mac Power Users have touted to be inferior on the iPad. Other things like using an iPad as a laptop replacement is argued to be only possible with sacrifice.\nWhile I don't necessarily believe in all of these claims I have to admit there is some merit to the issues that are raised by long-time Mac users. I have found myself getting more and more frustrated with the iPad. Not because I am doing more with it, I have been writing and blogging on an iPad for some time now and have never changed what I did on that machine. The reason for my frustration to be growing is because of something called Uncanny Valley.\nThe definition of Uncanny Valley is as follows:\n\n  used in reference to the phenomenon whereby a computer-generated figure or humanoid robot bearing a near-identical resemblance to a human being arouses a sense of unease or revulsion in the person viewing it.\n\nFor me it is more simply when I notice something that is very close to being optimal but isn't quite there. For a lot of the things I do on the iPad, this term could be used.\nWhy the iPad is so close, yet so far\nI have been touting being iPad only for nearly 6 months until recently. One of the reasons for me to crack open the MacBook Air again was because of how I decided to spend less time making the iPad conform to what I want and just use the Mac because I know it will work the way I want it to in certain situations.\nFor me, it started with editing a podcast. Ferrite is good but I am so used to Hindenburg that I am really fast on it and I felt using a new piece of software was more of a hindrance than a new skillset. I was so used to editing with Hindenburg that I felt that learning how to edit with Ferrite wasn’t worth the time as I was already pretty speedy on my Mac. It wasn’t a matter of if I could but rather a matter of if I should.\nSoon this started to fall into the blogging parts of my life. I could write with Ulysses without issue but I wanted something that I could use to handle my posts after they are published. I wanted to use something like MarsEdit for my iPad. But when the only thing available is the sub-par Wordpress app on iOS I decided to being my blogging over to my Mac as well. I am happy with MarsEdit, but that isn’t to say I can’t use the iPad for writing. In fact I think the iPad is more efficient when it comes to writing than a Mac. I can use apps like Drafts 5 and Workflow to manage my text and format things faster than I could on a Mac.\nWhere it Stands for Others\nOutside of my experience, I don’t think this Uncanny Valley phenomenon is anything new. I think the comparison of the iPad and Mac has been around for quite some time. You can do a quick google search and find articles from several years ago about how whether an iPad is or isn’t qualified to be a replacement for a Mac. However, because the iPad has gained more and more power and functionality it isn’t a stretch to believe that the reason why so many people aren’t team iPad is because it can’t handle the handful of things people use a Mac for over an iPad. Those small, but important, things are what prevents people from moving to the iPad full time. When you are given a microscope you notice the small things a lot more easily, and that is what is going on today with the iPad and Mac comparisons.\nIt isn’t impossible to use an iPad full time, I would know; but it doesn’t come without its drawbacks. They may be minor drawbacks when looking at the whole picture, but they are bigger when you look as close as many do when looking for a new device.\nFor me, I don’t plan to get a new Mac or iPad even if WWDC does bring some in the coming weeks. I am more than able to get by with my 2015 MacBook Air and 10.5” iPad Pro. Both handle my writing without issue, and both have the ability to edit podcasts without being bogged down. I am happy with both, or either, machines as of today, but that isn’t the case for everyone.\nAutomation\nWhen it comes to automating things like blog posts and show notes for my podcasts I am still using the iPad. It is my bread and butter for formatting things the particular way I want them and I am not savvy enough on a Mac to make that happen as of yet.\nDrafts 5, while being a new addition to my arsenal of daily apps, is the biggest factor for me choosing whether to use a Mac or an iPad. It is such a powerful tool that I can’t help but be drawn towards it.\nWorkflow is also an app I use daily for a multitude of things. From managing my images and having them formatted correctly to using it for converting lists into markdown. It really is a Swiss army knife that allows me to work between apps. Without it I don’t think the iPad would even come close to being a Mac alternative.\nWhat This Means For the iPad and Mac Today\nRight now, before WWDC 2018, I think the Mac needs some serious changes to the hardware. Specifically the keyboards. One of the biggest reasons I would move people towards an iPad today is because they don’t have to worry about a speck of dust destroying their entire machine. The iPad Pro is compatible in pricing, and, as I said before, can handle pretty much anything you throw at it. The Mac needs some changes in order to be worthwhile again, but that doesn’t mean the iPad is better overall.\nI think the iPad needs changes to the software. The bugs in iOS 11 have been less than ideal, and I think that is one of the biggest issues I have found with the iPad ecosystem as a whole. I am hoping that iOS 12 handles these bug and squashed them once and for all. If that does happen, I expect I’ll be moving more towards the iPad with my work.\nUntil then though I am enjoying the experiment of finding where my work is better suited for. It is less about what I can do on the devices I own, and more about where my time and attention are better suited for with each thing I do.\t\t\n",

      title: "Interview with Rosemary Orchard, Creator of Automation Orchard",
      category: null,
      content: "\n\t\t\t\tI had the pleasure of conducting an interview via email with Rose Orchard, a developer, blogger, and creator of Automation Orchard. Rose came on my radar when I found her on micro.blog a lot more over Twitter and Facebook. When I really learned more about her was on an episode of Mac Power Users and the launch of Automation Orchard. If you use an iPad or iPhone and want to make it an automation machine this is a fantastic place to start.\nI wanted to pick her brain a little about creating this project and how her workflows look as well. So I shot her some questions and this is what came from that. I want to thank Rose for doing this and taking her time. If you want to check how her stuff (I highly suggest you do) you can find her on her personal blog, and over at Automation Orchard.\n1. Can you tell the readers a little bit about yourself and who you are?\nI'm Rose, originally from the U.K. and living in Austria. I studied foreign languages at university and am currently working on my MSc in Computing (Software Engineering). I've been into computers ever since I was allowed to play with them but it took me a long time to decide that technology and programming were the career for me. Nowadays I'm a developer in Vienna.\n2. You recently launched a very impressive website called Automation Orchard, can you talk about what this site is and what it provides?\nIt’s a collection of resources with tags - so if you want to learn about Keyboard Maestro you can filter for that, or if you want to see automation for Things 3 then you can search for that too. The idea is it's a one stop shop to find the resources - the articles themselves are of course on their original websites.\n3. This website really is impressive, it has a ton of content and curation in it. How long did this take you to build? What kinds of workflows did you use to make this process easier for you?\nIt took me a little longer than I had planned to build - I changed the content structure about 3 times! In the end I did it over the course of about 4 months though.\nI decided early on the easiest way to collect the content was to use RSS and JSON feeds. So I started with the basics - MacStories, MacSparky, and kept adding more sites. I used Pythonista on my iPad to go through and save data about the articles, and then Workflow to review each article and create the posts if I chose to.\n4. You also blog on your own website using Grav. Is this something that you use an iPad for?\nYes! I do most things on iOS nowadays. I write my blog post drafts in Drafts, and then when they're done upload them via SFTP using Coda. Grav does have an admin UI but I rarely use it myself.\n5. Automation is clearly a very important topic and a passion of yours, can you elaborate how this came to be such an interest for you?\nI've always tried to avoid doing unnecessary work - from the beginning of my university studies I kept my bibliographies in a Numbers document - simply so I could automatically sort the entries alphabetically and paste them in at the end of an essay. I'm not quite sure why automation in particular caught my attention, but saving time and effort is certainly why I'm still interested today.\n6. What is something you use for automation that you’re proud of? This can be anything you want.\nI created Automation Orchard almost entirely with automation tools - I'm pretty proud of that! I've also got a lot of scripts I use at work to help me create and update documents quickly which save me lots of time.\n7. If someone wanted to get into automation, but maybe needed some help getting their feet wet, what would you say to them?\nLook for something you do a lot, and automate one step in it. Break it down into chunks, and find something simple - for example sending an email that has today's date in it. Once you've got that step you can look at the next one.\n8. How do you use iOS and the iPad in your work?\nAt work my iPad is my OmniFocus tool, it sits below my monitor and shows me my ever-growing to do list. For Automation Orchard my iPad is where I do all of my work now. I did use my Mac to set up a local site for testing and to edit the theme, but nowadays it's all on iOS - and that's the same for my blog too.\n9. What are some pros/cons you have found when using iOS in your work?\nMy iPad is fun to use. I use it more like a traditional laptop than many would I suspect - with a keyboard almost permanently attached, that's a definite pro. There are cons of course - some apps just aren't as good as their Mac counterparts, though thankfully most of the apps I use seem to not be of that kind.\nOne con is people don't really take you seriously with an iPad - at least until you show them what it can do. I remember a meeting last year where I got looked at more than once for using my iPad, but once I plugged it into the projector and used GoodNotes to sketch out the diagram we'd been discussing (using their shape recognition tool), and then typed up the notes we wanted recorded it became a nonissue.\t\t\n",

      category: null,
      content: "\n\t\t\t\tI listened to a talk from 2009 by John Gruber and Merlin Mann from SXSW about blogging, and it caused a carnival of thoughts to swirl in my mind. This is me trying to articulate them.\nI had never listened to this talk before, but because I started listening to the podcast Back To Work it made me want to listen to it as after being brought up so much in the first few episodes. I wanted to know if it still holds up, to see if the blogging platform is a shell of its former self. This talk couldn’t be more true today than it was then.\nThe talk, titled How To: 149 Ways to Turbocharge Your Blog with Credibility, was about an hour in length. Which made me sad because an episode of the The Talk Show can run twice that on average. I wanted more, I felt like there was a great deal more to learn from.\nWhy You Should Blog\nIt started with John and Merlin explaining one of the main points: to write about what delights you. To write about what you’re obsessed with. This main point would come up again and again throughout the talk. At one point Merlin would say:\n“How do you know that you should start a blog? People keep telling you to shut up.” - Merlin Mann\nI can’t say I am not part of this group. My fiancé is tired of me talking about Apple news, working on my iPad, and my feelings on productivity. It is something I have obsessed on in some capacity for years.\nAfter this, they talk about how you can’t, and probably shouldn’t, make everyone happy. Merlin says it best when he explains how he admires John because John’s voice and passion outweighs any obligation to make people happy. He doesn’t go out of his way to upset anyone but he also is steadfast to continue the path he feels is right. This is something I think I lack, and that I should be more assertive at times. Too often I try and be a cheerleader and suppress my negative feelings on certain things, and I think they are valid concerns I should be addressing. I don’t plan on making this blog a place to gripe and complain all the time, but there is a place for that concern and the feelings I have.\nFinding Your Audience\nNext on their list is finding an audience. Gruber explains his ideal reader is “another version of me.” The crowd laughs, almost as if to say “he can’t be serious,” but I feel the same way as John. I write on Tablet Habit because I imagine myself reading a blog like this that I never started. I imagine myself looking for a place that has similar feelings on Apple, iOS, and using an iPad as a main computer. That is my main motivator for writing here. There are other factors at play, but they are all distant seconds to the strong feelings I have to write about what delights and, at times, upsets me.\n\"Make something really kickass and try to impress the people you really love.\" - Merlin Mann\nWhen Merlin said this, I nearly jumped out of my seat with excitement. This is something I have felt for as long as I started podcasting back in 2009. Find someone you want to impress, and ask yourself every time you hit publish if that person will like it or think it’s garbage. If it’s the latter, do better. If it’s the former, send that thing to everywhere you can.\nWith that said, it is important, they say, to not try and piggyback off someone else’s success. A great example they provide with this is Ted Koppel, who found success as a broadcaster during the Iran hostage crisis. It caused the ABC show Nightline to be made, and it elevated Koppel to be one of the most well know journalists in that era. Side note: Nightline continues to be a great program of long-form news that I find to be more digestible than anything local or national news programs make today.\nBut the point they bring up, originallly made by Ira Glass from NPR’s This American Life, is that you can’t be Ted Koppel, he already exists. I can’t be John Gruber, or Merlin Mann, or Federico Viticci, those people already exist. What I can do, as they explain, is to learn from their work and try the things they did to get success. This goes for anyone looking to have success in a creative field, whatever your definition of that may be. Learn, but don’t emulate. Take their work and learn how they do the things they do.\nThe New Printing Press\nGruber then mentions an old saying:\n\"It is great that we have freedom of the press, but the only people that really have freedom of the press are people with a printing press.\"\nHe goes on to say that \"everyone has a printing press now thanks to the internet.” This is a point that especially made me think.\nI worry that the “golden age” of blogging is behind us. I feel that it was great to have this ease of disseminating information when the internet was more in its adolescence back on 2009. The internet is now a giant gorilla dwarfing every other piece of media day in and day out. The internet is no longer where the cool kids are. It’s where corporations, national news, and conglomerates come to spread their message. Is the internet killing the little guys like the printing press did so long ago? I thought so at this point in the talk, but that soon changed.\nWhen to Get Serious About Your Work\nAll of these pieces of advice and truth are great, but the most poignant point made throughout this was when Gruber took out a sheet of paper and explained that this was an email that Merlin Mann forwarded to him just before the talk. It was an email from a “20 year old kid” asking Merlin what he can to to get serious with his blog. What Merlin said came down to 3 short and direct pieces of advice:\n\n\nGive away more stuff than you think you should, and make it easy for people to get.\nFocus on diverse secondary revenue streams and always have your new and replacement ones.\nDon't do stuff that seems profitable, but potentially messes up the reason people like you.\n\n\nNot only is this advice sound, it is timeless. You could tell someone today these three things and they would all still be worthwhile. This isn’t just for bloggers. Artists, writers, journalists, painters, photographers, and YouTubers can take this advice and go a long way with it. Then John said something.\n“The internet is awesome, it is totally fucking awesome. It is not just that we all have a printing press now ... it is that we can do it better.” - John Gruber\nThis is what made my worries of corporations on the internet go away. Both Merlin and Gruber explained that corporations and big business are still failing to be anything other than giant billboards on a small screen. They don’t give anything away, they don’t offer the value indie bloggers give on a daily basis.\nMaking Money\nFinally, the two talk abut money and making a living on what you create.\n\"Don't become too obsessed with the thing you want to make money on.\" - Merlin Mann\nThis is probably the best quote to summarize this section. Money is important, but if you first think about wanting to make money and then start a blog, podcast, or something else creative it will almost always fail to meet your expectations in the time frame you set. If you instead flip it around and make something you love and then think about how you can make money with it your odds of success dramatically increase. There is no guarantee that you will make a living, or even a nickel, doing what you love but if you have a solid foundation the chances that house you build collapses on you decreases exponentially.\nFinal Thoughts\nThis talk, 9 years after it was first given, is still timeless and something I think anyone looking to seriously create a blog, podcast, portfolio, or YouTube channel. It manages to give you actionable advice while also providing the higher level of thinking necessary to make sure you are doing things the right way with the right reasons.\nIf you want to listen to it you can do so on 43 Folders, or just download the file directly here.\t\t\n",

      content: "\n\t\t\t\tMatt Birchler of BirchTree.me talked about using block quotes and link posts recently and it got me thinking.\nWhy I Love Link Blogging - BirchTree\nThe web allows us to create content that is connected with the rest of the web. Everything we do, especially us writers, is kicked off by something someone else said, and we should embrace that. Make your blog a part of a conversation, not an island that feels like you’re just doing this all on your own. None of us are, and we should be proud of that.\nHonestly, Matt hits the nail on the head with this one. Link blogging is a very standard way to build off of other bloggers and cite them as you expand your own thoughts. It also allows you to make internet friends with other awesome writers, and when you have people to work with and bounce ideas off of, they can be there to help you out.\nI have decided to start posting more link posts on Tablet Habit because there are so many awesome bloggers out there, and I want to join their conversations and join this community rather than be “an island” all alone.\nBlogging was something I did as a side-project to step away from podcasting. Since then I have started 2 podcasts (Getting Caught Up and A Slab of Glass), which is a story in itself, but writing here on Tablet Habit has become my favorite outlet for my creativity and continues to push me to do bigger and better things. For instance, I am publishing a free ebook of my favorite apps to get work done on an iPad at the end of the month. This is something I never would have done if I hadn’t started Tablet Habit.\nMatt is a blogger I found through someone else’s blog and/or Twitter, and I am happy I did. I hope to find more awesome writers in the near future as well, which is where you can help.\nIf you know any other bloggers feel free to let me know in the comments below, or over on Twitter. You can also email me if that is your preferred method of contact.\nI want to build up my RSS list with more awesome bloggers, so feel free to send as many as you want!\nIf you want to read the rest of Matt Birchler’s post, you can do so here. Check out the rest of his stuff too if you like it. His daily podcast is a delightful way to start your day off right!\t\t\n",

      title: "Cool Things You Can Do On Drafts 5",
      category: null,
      content: "This week's Workflow Wednesday is kind of an audible, but Drafts 5 was released today and I wanted to share some of the cool things you can do with it.\nThere are a slew of great reviews of this out there (like MacStories by nahumck, and Christopher Lawley's video). So I am going to let those fantastic people share their reviews and thoughts on what the app has to offer while I show you some really cool things Drafts in their Drafts 5 directory.\nSend List to Things\nI recently hopped on the Things 3 bandwagon, and so far I am loving it. However, I am not a huge fan of not having native multiple task input support. Meaning I want to be able to add a ton of tasks without having to input them one by one. This is where Drafts comes in.\n\nWith this handy action you can make a list and each new line is seen as a new task. So if I have a ton of things on my mind I want out and captured in Things 3 I can do so with just a single swipe and tap!\nRun Workflow\nI have spent a ton of time in Workflow, and I love the things I have built. Instead of trying to reinvent the wheel, Drafts has a handy action built in that you can simply have it run a previously built workflow. All you need to do is edit the action and put in the name of the Workflow. Make sure it is exactly the same, otherwise it will error out, this is one of those times where it is case-sensitive.\nOne workflow I have is to post Markdown text I’ve written as a Wordpress article. So with a quick tap Drafts takes the work I have written and takes it to Workflow to send to my blog. Super handy for the quick linked-posts I do from time to time.\nMicro.blog\nI have spent more and more time on the up-and-coming IndieWeb social media service Micro.blog. It has become a safe-haven for me to turn to when I wanted to leave Facebook and spend less time on Twitter. I find the community great and it has functions to send out my posts in Micro.blog to Twitter so I can kill two birds with one stone.\nDrafts makes it even easier for me. Now, I don't even need to open the app to send out a quick post. I can just type it out and then send it through the action and the rest is taken care of. This is why I love Drafts, I can quickly send out a post, a tweet, or a message to someone, and then keep right on trucking with my work.\nEvent in Fantastical\nI love Fantastical and their amazing natural language input they have, it makes adding calendar events fun again. But what is even easier is typing it out in Drafts and sending it to Fantastical 2 to sort out for me.\n\nAll I do is write something like \"Coffee with Jim next Thursday at 9am /p\" and it sends it to Fantastical with the name \"Coffee with Jim\" scheduled for next Thursday at 9am in my Personal calendar. Boom, event added. The “/p” portion is part of Fantastical syntax that takes the “/“ icon and a letter or two written out\nSave to File as\nDrafts 5 has cloud syncing and auto-saving feature with this app, but sometimes I want to keep a backup of the long posts I write in it, and plain text is my preferred method.\nSo, I have an action that takes the text I wrote in Drafts, it then prompts me to enter the file name I want. It defaults to a .txt but you can change the filetype to .md or .rtf if you so choose. For me .txt is fine so I leave it. From there it opens up the Files document picker and allows you to save it to any folder in iCloud, or other 3rd party cloud services you have turned on in the Files App, and save it. Now you have a backup of all your hard work!\nConclusion\nDrafts 5 is an app I have tried out for testing purposes, but it has easily become one of my absolute favorite apps on iOS. It allows me to get things out of my head and send them out when I want to. I no longer spend my mental RAM trying to figure out what I want to do first, the n what to say.\nDrafts makes the process a complete 180 from what it was. Instead of trying to find the app to use, then working on what I want to say, I now can work on getting my ideas and writing out of my head first then send it wherever it needs to. I just tap the app in my dock and dump what’s on my mind out of my head and it’s saved for later organization.\nFor me, this is how things should be when you have ideas and creativity: a frictionless workspace.\nIf you want to get Drafts 5, you can download it on the App Store. It is free, but if you want all the features you'll have to go Pro. It is either $19.99 a year or 1.99 a month. For me, I am paying the $1.99 a month because it allows me to pay Greg more money then $19.99 a year. That is how much I love this app.\n",

      category: null,
      content: "\n\t\t\t\t\nWhen you are working hard and doing the important things in your day you can find that your iPad Smart Cover might not be in the pristine condition as you would hope. Things like crumbs, dust, cat hair, and other residue on your keyboard can make the typing experience less than ideal. This can be easily fixed with some water and a couple of paper towels. So let’s make a clean iPad Smart Keyboard.\nHow to Clean Your iPad Smart Keyboard\nOne thing you can do, according to Apple, is get a damp cloth (or in my case a paper towel) and wipe the Smart Cover to get any residue or dust off the device. Once you do that you will want to get a dry cloth or paper towel and wipe away any water off the devices before they cause any damage.\nMake sure your iPad is not connected to the keyboard. Once you start cleaning the keyboard don’t be shy with getting in between the keys. I found using some elbow grease really made the difference. Don’t use all your might to clean this but don’t be afraid to press down on the keys to scrub off whatever is on the keyboard.\nI also found that having a clean microfiber cloth also helped get those pesky pieces of dust and cat hair off the keyboard. In my case, I had a microfiber cloth I got at my local Dollar Store. If that doesn’t work the first time around I would give it another go with just a little more water.\nOne thing I cannot stress enough is that the cloth or paper towel you use only needs to be a bit damp. It doesn’t need to be sopping wet, a dab will do you. While the Smart Keyboard is water resistant, there are small holes on the back of the keyboard to vent air out of the keyboard every time you press a key.\nSo if you can’t stand the dust and hair stuck to your keyboard, give it a quick once over and make it shine like new again.\n",

      title: "Post to Wordpress on iOS - Workflow Wednesday",
      category: null,
      content: "If you blog on iOS, sometimes you want to send a quick post to your Wordpress site as soon as possible. The Wordpress app on iOS has come a long way in recent years, but when you are just sending a quick post dealing with the app can be cumbersome. This is where my workflow comes in.\nWhat it is\nThis workflow is quite simple on the surface. However, thanks to Workflow&rsquo;s integration with Wordpress, you can handle even the most advanced options on every post you share. Things like the slug, post format, tags, excerpt, etc. are all options with this workflow.\nWhat it Does\nThe Workflow starts by asking you the title of the post, which is then saved for later use as a variable.\nAfter that it asks if you have a featured image for the post. This is an option of yes or no. If you say yes, it then opens up the Photos app to select the photo you wish to be the featured image.\n\nFinally comes the fun part. Posting a blog post on Wordpress can be fairly easy, but this workflow also allows you to handle the minutia if you so choose.\nOnce you connect your Wordpress site to Workflow you&rsquo;re ready to start blogging your heart out!\nTweaks You Can Make\nI have set this workflow to only ask for the categories and tags, but you can edit this workflow to ask you for more information if you want to have more control in each post you make. Simple go to the section you want to integrate with your workflow and tap the &ldquo;Ask When Run&rdquo; option. This will now ask you for an input every time you run the workflow.\nI have also made this workflow with Rich Text in mind, if you prefer to write in Markdown you can add an action to convert rich text to Markdown if you would like. Everything I write is in Markdown, but I wanted to leave the option to you.\nAlso, if you prefer to select images in your iCloud or Dropbox folder instead of Photos, simple replace that action with a &ldquo;Get File&rdquo; action within Workflow.\nYou can download the workflow here. If you have any questions feel free to leave a comment below, or contact me.\n",

      title: "The 9 Things I Learned Going iPad Only",
      category: null,
      content: "Going “iPad only” wasn’t a goal for me until recently. Before then it was just something I felt more comfortable using over a Mac. Now that I have made this blog it got me thinking about all the things I learned by making my iPad my main device. These are some of them.\nIt’s Easier Than You Think\nWhen I first set out to make my iPad Air 2 my main computer back in college it seemed too daunting and scary. A lot of these questions came at me when I left for class without my Mac, knowing that I only had this tablet to handle all of my work.\nHow will I handle my files? How can I make sure I keep things on task? What about my trackpad?!\nBy the end of the day, though, I realized that there wasn’t anything that really got in my way of my work. Things like taking notes, writing papers, or even researching for other assignments came easy. This small piece of glass seemed to handle everything I threw at it.\nSomething about working with this device made sense to me. This was the beginning of something magical for me.\nLike many things in life, I decided to disregard my reservations about trying something new. I just dove in head first into the sea of the unknown, only to come out the other side a more experienced person. Going iPad only seemed like a silly idea, but in practice it allowed me to do my work freely and with more joy.\nLess is More\nLimitation is often seen as a negative thing, but for me having that limiter on myself makes my life a lot easier. It’s not about making decisions on how I do my work, but more on the work itself.\nFor instance, recording a podcast on an iPad isn’t impossible, but it does require a lot of effort and some sacrifice. I wrote about podcasting on iOS before, but to reiterate I have to use both my iPhone and my iPad to record a podcast successfully. I did this because even though it isn’t a pretty solution, I can still do it with just an iPad and my iPhone. I was able to take a theory and turn it into a proof. I also did this because I really wanted to go iPad only, even if it meant function over form.\nThere are some things you can’t do on iOS that you can on a Mac or PC; but they are so seldom that I often don’t need to worry about it on a day to day use. Plus, with limitation comes innovation, and I have stripped down a lot of the things in my workflow because of iOS. I also have learned a lot from it as well.\nYou Learn a Lot About iOS\nIf I only used my iPad when I was on the go instead of all the time, there are a lot of things I wouldn’t know I could do with an iPad. I would have had the instinctual reaction to open up my MacBook Air instead of trying to find a solution with the tools I already had in front of me.\nOne of the big ones for me is automation and using the app Workflow. There are a number of things I never would think I could do on an iPad that Workflow allows me to do with ease. For instance, converting rich text into Markdown has been a hassle for me for years. That is until Workflow built a simple tool to take that text and convert it to a fully functional Markdown.\n  &lt;img src=\"https://tablethabit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/FD918E79-61F8-4E66-8B8E-250A44EE177F-1.png\" alt=\"\"/&gt;\n\nTo go even deeper with this, I have also learned how to bend and contort many types of media to the specific types I need them in. It’s all thanks to the brilliant minds behind Workflow and knowing what I needed to make these alterations happen without a hitch.\nThe iPad Can Be a Workhorse\nWorking on my iPad has been my preferred device ever since I realized how little there is I can’t do with this device. My work can be done on an iPad about 90% of the time no problem. The other 10% is where things get tricky. Doing something like editing a podcast, making graphics for the website becomes problematic on any iOS device.\nThis isn’t to say I can’t do those things on iOS, but because I am a creature of habit I still am apprehensive to migrate it over to the iPad. I am slowly moving towards Ferrite for podcast editing and recording, as well as Pixelmator for photo editing. The only problem I still am yet to tackle is editing the website. I still need to use a Mac for it, albeit on a seldom basis.\nBut to set aside the 10% I don’t use with my iPad, the fact that this machine has gone from a giant iPhone into a full-fledged Mac replacement is astonishing to me. I still find it a shock to my system when I think about all the things I need to do that get done solely on my iPad.\niOS is the OS for Me.\nI have been an Apple use for years, ever since I got my iPhone 4s I made the switch from Android and PC to iOS and macOS. I have owned a Mac longer than I owned any iOS device.\nWith that said, macOS has slowly drifted away from me like Wilson in the movie Cast Away. Instead of screaming for the Mac to come back to me, however, I have found solace in iOS.\nTo me, iOS is equally lightweight in robust tasks I barely do, and more flexible with the minimal tasks I do. I can write and blog without having several apps open, yet I can edit a podcast if I so choose.\nI mentioned already how working with my hands is a satisfying thing, but it isn’t just that I control it with touch. Working on the iPad, for me, has changed the way I look at computers all together.\nThe Mac was a window into the world, the iPad is more a window into the things important to me.\nI am not here to badmouth the Mac, but to say that the Mac is a good alternative to an iPad would be doing the iPad a disservice. I would actually counter it with the iPad being a good alternative to the Mac. At least for me.\nPortability Becomes More Important\nUntil I started to use my iPad, I used to think that my 13” 2015 MacBook Air was the epitome of portable. Now, in the seldom times I need to open the Macbook, it seems like a giant computer. It makes my shoulders hurt just thinking about lugging it around town with me as I work from coffee shops and local libraries.\nThe iPad is perfect for someone who is on the go and working from place to place. It offers keyboard accessability, but it isn’t required to work with it. the fact that you don’t need to have a surface to hold it is something you don’t appreciate until you are in that position.\nIf I could explain this feeling, it is like having a piece of paper to write with. But when you finally need to write on that sheet of paper, you then need to find a surface flat enough to write on. Now imagine the iPad is a proverbial clipboard, allowing you to write anywhere you go as you wander the area. That is the relief and ease I am talking about with the iPad.\nThe iPad Really Can Replace Your Other Computers\nDo you remember those “I’m a Mac, and I’m a PC” commercials? I think back on those a lot. Mainly as a question of what would Apple be comparing these days with those two actors? For me it would be an iPad and everything else.\n“I’m an iPad, and I’m everything else,” could start the commercial. Then Apple could talk about how the Apple Pencil is the most efficient stylus on the market. Or how the iPad allows your to work on the best hardware Apple has to offer with the best OS as well. The comparisons are endless.\nIt Is Much More Enjoyable\nSpeaking of joy, working on an iPad can be a lot of fun. Something about working on a device with my hands is just so satisfying. I still use the iPad with a keyboard for the most part. But at times where I need to use Drag and Drop or editing photos with Pixelmator, I notice how much more I enjoy handling the mundane. Using my hands to physically move and edit things over a mouse or trackpad is just nice compared to a more “traditional” computer.\nTapping and sliding my fingers on the glass is a lot like ice skating. The flow in which I feel in my hands only validates that feeling more. I feel like I am soaring through my work much more efficiently and elegantly than I would on any other device.\nOn top of that, when I got the iPad Pro I bought the Apple Pencil. It’s still one of my favorite tools Apple has made. Writing notes down on a pen and paper is still satisfying, but being able to do it on my iPad still feels like the future. the latency is next to nothing, and the feeling you get writing on the glass screen is incomparable.\nI love opening up GoodNotes 4 and jotting down ideas for Tablet Habit and having them saved digitally. Unlike a notebook, if I lost my iPad tomorrow I would still have all of my notes saved on the cloud for safekeeping.\nWhere There’s a Will, There’s a Way\nAll of the people I know who are iPad only (or even iPad first) have taken the limitations of iOS in stride. Some, like me, use the limitations as a means of focus. Others, like Federico Viticci over at MacStories, have found ways to bypass those limitations. He creates Workflows, automation, and even writing his own code to make iOS work for him. In both cases pro users of the iPad will hit some roadblocks, but they take that as a challenge rather than a disadvantage.\nSo much of what I do can be done without many bumps in the road. But when I do get to an area where there are some road blocks, I take it as a chance to learn more about the systems in which I do my work. I want to find ways to make my own detours towards my destination.\nSomething about iOS, and those who use it as their main OS, makes you want to push forward and raise the bar just a little higher each and every day. I am sure there are other communities like us, but for me this feels like home.\nWhat’s Next\nThe iPad is a tremendous machine, and a testament that Apple continually innovates their products years after it comes out. There is very little I have to say negatively about the iPad, but in the future I hope Apple keeps their momentum with the iPad going. A version of this device has been out over 8 years now and I hope in another 8 years I am as satisfied and pleasantly surprised as I am today.\nFor now, the iPad will continue to be the device I take with me everywhere I go. Whether it is to catch up on some news, or to write an ebook, the iPad will be my computer of choice.\nIf you want to make the switch and go iPad only, sign up to get my free ebook coming out at the end of April. It will show you the 20 apps to get productive on the iPad, and how you can make the transition from Mac and PC over to iOS.\n",

      content: "This is a new weekly segment I am doing called Workflow Wednesday. Every Wednesday I will be sharing workflows I have either made myself or found elsewhere that is worth sharing with you. If you haven’t tried out Workflow yet I highly suggest downloading it (it’s free).\nWhat The Workflow Is\nThis week is how to get the app icons from an App Store URL. Meaning that you can share a link from the App Store and then run a workflow that will get the image of the app icon, and mask it to look like a home screen version of it. This is great if you are writing a blog post or want to use an app icon of something to share in a document or website.\n  &lt;img src=\"https://tablethabit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/1A8BE57B-EFA4-48CA-8E68-1F8A0C70D013.png\" alt=\"\"/&gt;\n\nHow it Works\nThe masking part of this is a new addition to the latest Workflow update and it’s probably my favorite thing about Workflow image manipulation as of right now. It makes things very easy to conform image to match the style of app icons. You can also use the mask for other things like a rounded rectangle, an ellipse, or even your own custom image. I have not tested the custom image just yet but according to MacStories it can be done with some trial and error.\n\n  in my early tests with this feature, I had fun using random images from my photo library as masks and understanding how Workflow treated their brightness as a custom alpha mask. According to the app's documentation, darker colors in the alpha mask become transparent and lighter colors remain opaque; the mask is also resized to match the dimensions of the source image if necessary.\n\nHow to Use It\nOnce you download the workflow it is simple to run it and save the image for later use.\nSimply open the App Store and find the app you want to save the icon for and tap “Share App.”\n  &lt;img src=\"https://tablethabit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/6FFBD398-784D-4900-B314-0BE1476436FD.png\" alt=\"\"/&gt;\n\nFrom there tap the “Run Workflow” option in the share sheet. If you don’t see it you may need to check and see if you have it enabled. To do that scroll all the way to the right on the bottom section and tap “More” and make sure the Run Workflow option it switched on.\n  &lt;img src=\"https://tablethabit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/0D6DDB96-BCFD-4D13-AE46-CB60EB400B5D.png\" alt=\"\"/&gt;\n\nFinally, select the App Icon Workflow you just installed. For you it may be more towards the bottom depending how many workflows you have that are action extensions.\n  &lt;img src=\"https://tablethabit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/AD25A00D-FFE1-44FC-82A6-C56D73311646.png\" alt=\"\"/&gt;\n\nThis workflow came in handy for me when I was working on getting the images for a new ebook I am working on. I took the apps I wanted to cover in this ebook and ran this workflow to make the app icons and then save them in a folder on my iCloud for later use in Pages.\nAll in all this may be a simple workflow but it has been getting a lot of mileage from me and I think if you ever want to grab an app icon this will do the job for you.\nYou can download the workflow here if you would like it.\n&lt;\np id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_151442\"&gt;If you have any requests for workflows for me to build feel free to contact me and let me know!\t\t\n",

What do you do when you have nothing scheduled? For me, I decided to utilize my calendar more and fill up that white space. Some call it hyper-scheduling, other call it time boxing, but I call it time blocking.\nWhatever you call it, it basically means that I plan everything in my day within my calendar app. If I have plans to write, it goes in the calendar. If I plan to edit a podcast, it goes in the calendar. If I want to work on more administrative work, it goes in the calendar.\nBut before I explain how, I think knowing why will help understand what brought this change.\nWhy Time Blocking?\nThe reason I started to do this is because I was frustrated with task managers for iOS. I wanted to go about task management from a completely different angle than I had been. My issues with task managers has boiled down to having a lot of things in one place, and then not knowing what to do with it. I know about the weekly review process Getting Things Done (GTD) has in place, and I have tried that. I just never seem to stick with it. I think my brain isn’t wired for a GTD-style task management system, which is a hard pill to swallow because I have been trying to use GTD for years with little to no success. It also doesn’t help when I have a lot on my plate in many aspects of my life.\nI wear a lot of different hats. I write for Tablet Habit and do a weekly newsletter. I am a freelance podcast editor, I co-host two podcasts, and I also have a day job. Those are a lot of different things I handle on a regular basis, and I needed to figure out how to maintain and advance my goals for each. Enter Time Blocking.\nHow I Got Started Time Blocking\nThe first thing I needed to do with time blocking was to figure out what I need to get done each week in order to maintain the different areas of my life. So I got a pen and paper and started to write down everything I needed to get done each week and what area of my life that falls in to.\nI had an idea of what I had to do it was now a matter of when. So I took the time sensitive stuff first and made all-day events for when I am doing things like posting podcast episodes and blog posts. They are things that need to be done that day, but not at a specific time. It also helps me keep track of these things because all day events are at the top no matter what. Which makes it super easy to find when I am skimming my upcoming week.\nFrom there I worked backwards to determine when the drafts of my posts are “due” and when to have each episode of the podcast edited. Christopher Lawley edits A Slab of Glass so thankfully I just need to plan for each episode and record them. Getting Caught Up, however, requires me to edit each episode.\nMy plan is to have each episode editing 3 days prior to posting day. Since the show is a fortnightly show it isn’t too hard to manage that schedule. I gave myself 3 days before the release of each episode so I can work on things like show notes, chapters, and all the other things that goes into a podcast after it is cut. So far, it seems to be working.\nOnce I had an idea of where to put the time-sensitive stuff, I now had to put the rest in. My thought process for this was to theme each day of the week. For instance, I could have my Mondays be when my first draft of my big post a week is due. Or have Thursdays be when I outline the weekly small post. Then it isn’t a matter of me checking the calendar daily, instead I just need to know what day of the week it is and know what it is I need to get done.\n  &lt;img src=\"https://tablethabit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/444033B4-BBC8-46D1-8F70-8E580609AED9.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/&gt;\n\nI shared this in my newsletter, and I plan to write more about it there, but after I started putting events in my calendar I realized that I could be doing this way more efficiently on my Mac. By that I mean that handling events in a calendar and making sure every detail in it is correct can be tedious. It is doubly so when you then want to input custom repeating structures in it. So I decided to put the iPad down and crack open my MacBook Air to get this done.\nI didn’t like the idea of needing to use a Mac to get this done. It’s something I hate to admit, but sometimes the iPad falls short, and this is one of those times.\nOnce I gathered my themes for each day it was a simple process of making events to match the theme, and then having them repeat where necessary. From there it is a set-it-and-forget-it kind of thing.\nI will say that I add things in my calendar from time to time and move my events for the day around if need be. This is done on iOS with Readle’s Calendars 5 app. I recently switched to this app from Fantastical 2 because it offered a much nicer weekly view.\nThis app, unlike Fantastical, doesn’t emphasize on the agenda style of planning as much. In fact, it resembled more of a calendar app you would find on Apple’s stock calendar app, but it offered natural language input which is one of the reasons I loved Fantastical. I am not sure how long I will stick with this, but I will say that I feel that Calendars 5 handles the fluidity of my system very easily once it is in place.\nConclusion\nWith this system in place there are a few things about this system that makes me nervous.\nThe first thing being that if I don’t stick with this and I miss something due to some unforeseen reason that I will just assume that my entire day will be shot now. A cartoon I recently discovered sums this up beautifully.\nMy second concern is that I will not know what to do when a new idea or task has to be done will go. For now I think the answer to this is going to be using either my current task manager OmniFocus 2 or use Apple’s Reminders app as it integrates within Calendars 5 natively.\nThere is going to be some testing and experimentation with this until I find a solution I am happy with. Until then though, you can follow along on my weekly newsletter. So if you are interested to keep up with this you can do so there. I also plan to answer any questions you may have about this or anything iPad/iOS related in the newsletter as well. To ask a question just fill out the form here.\t\t\n",

      category: null,
      content: "When blogging on Tablet Habit I have gotten the question of how I do it all from my iPad. It is a fairly simple process, but it can be hard to build from scratch, so I want to break it down here.\nBefore I get into it though, I want to make a quick note. I write in Markdown. If you write in Markdown this should be pretty easy to follow along. If you don’t know Markdown, you can find out more from the creator of it, John Gruber, on his site Daring Fireball.\nAlso, this is primarily for anyone using Wordpress as their blogging platform. That is the service I use as well as a large portion of other websites on the internet. It is a free, open-source platform and is absolutely worthy of the praise it has received over the years. I will happily help those who use other platforms like Squarespace if they would like. Information on how to contact me is at the bottom of this post.\nWith that out of the way, I am basically going to format this as a step-by-step process of planning, writing, and posting on a WordPress blog.\nBrainstorming\n  &lt;img src=\"https://tablethabit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/mindmap-photo.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/&gt;\n\nSo the first thing is to brainstorm your article. You can do this in a Markdown app you will eventually write this in, or use a mind mapping tool like iThoughts and MindNode. You can even use a pen and paper. The only requirement for this is to get everything out of your head and onto a page or screen. Emptying your brain is key to allow for more mental RAM when actually writing the article. Don’t be afraid to dump anything and everything down, even if it has nothing to do with the project at hand.\nForget to take the trash out? Write it down at the bottom of a page or note on your iPad. Just get it out of your head and write it down. The less you have swirling in your mind the less distractions you will have when actually doing the work.\nFrom there, clean out the things not about the blog post and put them elsewhere, like a task manager or even a different sheet of paper, you can deal with it later. Really focus your outline and/or mind map to one specific goal at a time, in this case it is the blog post.\nWriting\nOnce you know the topic and have some kind of idea what you want to say, it is time to write it into a post. Open your text editor of choice and start using that outline you wrote as a basis of what you want to say.\nSide-Note: If you want some good Markdown text editing apps I highly recommend Ulysses, Byword, iA Writer, or Editorial. There are a ton of posts elsewhere that will get in the weeds on Markdown apps so you’ll be able to find one that is right for you in no time. Anyway, back to the writing portion of things.\nOne thing I like to do is focus on one part at a time. This can be the introduction, conclusion, item 1 of 5 if you are posting a top 5 style post, or so on. For me, I like to have the introduction and conclusion done first. It helps me know what I want to have as the “meat and potatoes” of the post. Bookending the main points I want to make allows me to work with the constraints I put on myself. If that doesn’t work for you try something else out.\nThere really is no wrong way of writing, but I do have one piece of advice for anyone wanting to do anything on the internet: Really take your time and make something worthwhile here. Hang your hat on your work.\nSo get things right instead of just getting it done. Once it is done and you want to share it with the world, you have to know what to do with those words you’ve written to get on your website.\nExporting and Posting online\nAfter writing the article, comes exporting it to Wordpress.\nThere are a number of ways to do this but if you are using an app that has integration with Wordpress you are halfway there. Ulysses and Byword both have this built in. From within the app with integration you can actually send your post straight to the Wordpress website. Just login to your website and in the app there is an option to publish (if you need help finding it let me know what app you are using and I’ll happily help you out).\n  &lt;img src=\"https://tablethabit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ulysses-publishing-500px.png\" alt=\"\"/&gt;\n\n\n\n\n  &lt;img src=\"https://tablethabit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/byword-publishing-500px.png\" alt=\"\"/&gt;\n\nAlternatively, if the app you want to use doesn’t have built in Wordpress integration you can still post to your blog. You just have to use the app Workflow. You will need to convert your Markdown text into rich text. Here is a quick and easy Workflow you can use to accomplish this. It converts the Markdown text into rich text and then sends it to Wordpress. Upon first use you will need to sign in to Wordpress so make sure you have that information at the ready. But after that initial setup you are set to post away!\nIf you are using an app that is already rich text (Notes, Microsoft Word, etc.) then you can delete the conversion block in the workflow and just have it take the text and make a post on WordPress directly, or you can download this Workflow I made.\nFrom there you can go to your Wordpress post either in Safari or the Wordpress app and you can edit the post, add a featured image, change the SEO or meta data, and then post it.\nUploading Images to Wordpress\nThere is one more thing I wanted to share with you that helped me a ton. It is related to images. Uploading images to Wordpress from an iPad can be a royal pain if you let it. I created a workflow that allows you to upload an image from Photos right to WordPress and then copy the link of that image so you can paste it into your Markdown text editor. It comes in handy especially if you write in Markdown and want to share that image within world. You can download that workflow here.\nPLEASE NOTE: you will need to change the domain from tablethabit.com to whatever your domain is. Otherwise your links won’t be right. Also, this only works if you have a custom website as the link it creates is based on a custom domain. If anyone knows a way to make this work with a Wordpress.com website I would love to know!\nCongratulations! You just posted your blog using nothing but your iPad!\nIf you have any thoughts or ideas on how to improve this feel free to let me know on Twitter or get in contact with me.\n",

      category: null,
      content: "\nApple's new iPad suddenly confused everything. For some Mac users, it didn't seem like it could be powerful enough to serve as a computer. Market researchers immediately branded it as a \"media consumption device\" in a desperate effort to avoid any comparison with PC sales and to disavow any potential for it disrupting sales of Windows PCs, despite their having spent the previous couple years preaching the gospel that cheap, ultralow-end netbook PCs would certainly eat up sales of Macs.\nYet despite waves of media contempt citing certain users' disgruntlement, a deluge of market research white papers explaining that iPad wasn't a real computer, and thunderous umbrage from Adobe expressing outrage over iPad's lack of support for its proprietary Flash content (all of which sounded virtually identical to the themes in this year's launch of HomePod), real world users voted for iPad with their billions of dollars.\nI haven’t been in the Android game in quite some time but this seems to show just how impenetrable the iPad is in the tablet market. There really isn’t anything that comes close that has had as much support and iterations as the iPad.\nHonestly this entire article is just a great historical piece on tablets over the last 9 years. Daniel Eran Dilger did a great job on this and you should all read this.\t\t\n",

      title: "How To Annotate Screenshots on iOS 11",
      category: null,
      content: "When you want to share your screen on iOS it has become second nature to just take a screenshot and send it to the person you want to share it with, usually without any editing. This can be useful, but an even better solution is to add things like text, arrows, handwritten words, etc. to that screenshot. It can give whoever is getting that image that little extra reference to help then understand what you are sending.\nA great example of this is when a family member needs help with a setting in iOS or has a technical support question. A simple screenshot that may help, but a screenshot with an arrow or an explanation on what to do can save you a ton of time (and headaches).\nWith iOS 11 this has never been more accessible and easy to use.\nAnnotate On iPad\nTo start, you can take a screenshot by pressing the Home Button and the power button at the same time. The only outlier with this is the iPhone X as it does not have a Home Button. To do this you simple press the side button and the volume up button simultaneously.\nThere is also a way you can take a screenshot with a keyboard attached to your iOS device. If you are a Mac user you probably know the shortcut. You can use pres SHIFT+ ⌘ (cmd)+3 to take a screenshot. You can also take a screenshot and immediately get into the annotation with the keyboard shortcut SHIFT+⌘(cmd)+4. Both are staple keyboard shortcuts that works in any app you are using. So pick what ever method you want to get the screenshot(s) as you see fit. After that is where the real fun begins.\nOnce you get that screenshot, a small photo of the screenshot shows up on the bottom left corner of your screen. If you take multiple screenshots, they stack on top of each other to indicate that you have multiple screenshots.\n  &lt;img src=\"https://tablethabit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/screenshot-left-corner.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/&gt;\n\nFrom there you can either tap on the screenshot(s) and the built in iOS annotation will come up with a plethora of options at your disposal. You can crop the image, write on it to create arrows or hand write some stuff explaining things.\nAlternatively, if you decide you don’t need to annotate or edit the image you can press and hold on the screenshot on the bottom left and the Share Sheet will pop up to send wherever you like.\nOne great example of what an annotate image can provide is a screenshot I recently got was from my co-host of A Slab of Glass, Christopher Lawley, who shared his thoughts not the redesign of Tablet Habit.\n  &lt;img src=\"https://tablethabit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/chris-annotation.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/&gt;\n\nHe pointed out the two things he thought needed changing on the site (he was totally right and I have since changed the menu and image like he recommended).\nThis is the power of screenshots and specifically annotating them.\nAlong with the crop tool, pen, pencil, and highlighter options you get in the built in iOS editor you also have this lasso tool, which is underrated if you ask me. With this you can select any and all added markings on the image and move them around as you see fit. Below is a quick video of what I am talking about.\n[video width=\"1440\" height=\"1080\" mp4=\"[tablethabit.com/wp-conten...](https://tablethabit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DD3105D9-AD4E-4C94-A50F-68173B2E9181.mp4)\"][/video]\nSo these are the tools you get with the built in annotation, but what if you want to do more advanced stuff with your screenshots? This is where 3rd party apps come in.\n3rd Party Apps for Annotation\nOne app I love to use for annotating images for Tablet Habit is Annotable. It is a 3rd party app that allows you to do some pretty amazing things. I personally love the spotlight feature where everything you select is at the foreground while the rest of the unselected areas of the screenshot are dimmed to showcase the selected areas. It is great to point people where to look in a way that is appeasing to the the eyes.\n   [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"2224.0\"] Spotlight Feature with Annotable[/caption]\n\nIf you want to learn more about Annotable and other apps that are great additions for annotation check out The Sweet Setup’s article and pick the right app for you.\nSo if you find yourself wanting to share your screen with someone, maybe a few seconds of editing a screenshot can help.\nIf you think I missed something about this or want to give any advice you have about annotating screenshots on iOS feel free to leave a comment below or get in contact with me.\n",

      title: "Using Bear as an Apple Notes Replacement",
      category: null,
      content: "Note-taking has become a staple in any modern computer in your pocket, backpack, or tablet sleeve. That much is clear, but the apps in which people write their notes in has been a point of contention ever since there were blogs.Apple Notes was my app of choice ever since I switched to iOS and has been my go-to note-taking app since, until I started using Bear shortly after its release.\nThere are a number of reasons that I can now say that Apple Notes is no longer my favorite note-taking app, here are a few of them.\nMarkdown\nMarkdown has been my preferred syntax in writing since Is started to learn it in 2014. It is simple, effective, and doesn’t require anything special.\nJohn Gruber created an amazing way to write the majority of what is needed in blogging without ever needing anything except a word processor and a few specific characters memorized.\nMarkdown not only is a very nice tool to use on other platforms, it also is universal and allows you to write what you have to say and focus less on how you’re going to say it. Apple Notes doesn’t have Markdown support, instead it has its own formatting stuff that pretty much boxes itself out from other apps if you want to move it elsewhere. Essentially, Apple Notes makes your words and ideas squatters in a home, only coming out with certain conditions and rules.\nI will say that Bear has its own “flavor” of Markdown, but with a quick change in the General Settings of Bear you can put it into “Markdown Compatibility Mode” and all will be the same as other Markdown apps.\nThis entire review was written in Markdown inside the Bear app. Including all the images, links, and text formatting you see.\nCustomization\nThere are a number of things you can customize within Bear that you simply can’t in Apple Notes, making Bear offer a unique and personalized experience to whomever is using it. Notes has improved their overall look from a journal with lined paper to now a clean look where your words pop.\nHowever, changing the background color, the font, and the font size leaves a lot to be desired. Some of these things can be done on Apple Notes, but not easily nor to the capacity Bear offers.\nThemes\nWhere Bear shines brighter than other writing applications is their themes. From light themes, dark themes, and everything in between Bear offers the look a vast majority of people would want when they are writing notes, or even long form.\nThe dark themes are especially eye-catching because of how useful they can be for people that find a white text on a black screen easier to work with than the illuminating white background and black text.\nTo date there are 13 theme options, some being from a recent update earlier this year. I personally like the High Contrast theme for a light theme and Panic Mode as a dark theme.\n\nA really nice addition is that each theme has its own app icon as well. You can choose whether to use the theme icon or not when selecting one in the app.\nTypography\nOne feature I didn’t know about until very recently is that you can change the font in the app, which blew me away because it offered a whole other level of customization I didn’t even think I needed. Needless to say I played around with it and found that I actually prefer the system font over the standard Avenir Next font it ships with. Something about have the same uniform font across all applications is more appealing to me. There are a few other options to match most peoples needs. To change the font simply go to Settings within Bear and tap on “Editor” and from there you will see the option for “Typography.”\nOrganization and Functionality\nSo far I have only spoken about the cosmetic features Bear offers, which are great, but when you are talking about a notes application the proof is in the pudding. To stick with the analogy, Bear’s “pudding” is so rich you won’t be able to enjoy any other pudding the same way again.\nChecklists\nWhen I work with my notes, I sometimes find myself needed to make a list of items or things to do into a checklist, which used to mean I would take the list I created in Apple Notes and have to create a Workflow to make this list into a format another Markdown app supports. With Bear, it is a simple selection of the text and tapping on a checkbox in their custom shortcut menu.\nNot only that, but Bear has sweat the details so much you can go into settings and have it automatically fold any sub-lists once the main item is checked off. Meaning you don’t have to deal with the 16 tasks under one big project checklist you created after completion. Next time you enter the app all the completed tasks will fold into a gray icon with three dots. Which allows more screen real estate available to the remaking unchecked items.\n\nBear checklist before fold\n\nBear checklist with fold\nTagging system\nOrganizing your notes and lists in Apple Notes is probably the most frustrating thing about the app. Not only can you not sync your notes with third party services like Dropbox, you aren’t allowed any subfolders. So if you have plans to keep notes for that big project for work, the project has to have its own folder rather than being a subfolder within the Work folder you already had.\nWith Bear that all goes away, because Bear uses something similar, but different. They use a tagging system, and they allow sub-tags. For all intents and purposes this is the same as folders and subfolders. Regardless of the terminology, Bear allows you to have those project notes inside its own folder wherever you want. It doesn’t have to be a top-level folder.\nBear has actually made some serious updates to their tagging system as of late. They have now implemented autocomplete features so when you begin typing a tag within the not a pop-up dialog box appears where you can then select any existing tags that fit what is already written. It makes thing a lot easier from an organizational standpoint, and prevent users from using several tags that all have the same meaning.\nThe Little Things\nNow that I have converted both the cosmetic and the functional portion of Bear, there are still some things that these developers have put in that deserve to be mentioned.\nIcons for tags\nBear’s tagging system is not only very functional, they managed to put in a few secret nuggets of fun to boot. If you use tags like “Podcast” or “Blog” or “Personal” Bear automatically assigns icons (what they are calling “TagCons” for now) for those tags that are seemingly prebuilt in the application.\n Bear TagCons\nIf you use a tag that doesn’t meat this hidden criteria, they will use a generic “#” instead, which looks all well and good, but those TagCons that appear magically really make all the difference.\nHandling of Drag and Drop\nWhen I am working on notes for my podcast Getting Caught Up I tend to use a lot of links to things mentioned in the show. As I said before I prefer Markdown, as it is my favorite way to write, but it also is supported by my podcast host, Simplecast.\nBefore Bear I had to copy and paste each link in a new document, then find the summary and/or title of the articles I grabbed and then put in a serious amount of time to do the tidying up.\nWith Bear, I simply have to drag from the page in Safari and drop in into my Bear note where it gets the heading of the page and uses that as the text to encase the URL in. It makes for bringing webpages and articles a breeze and easily saves me an hours work.\nWhat Bear isn’t doing that Notes can\nWhile it is easy to tell I am a fan of Bear, there are some things that Apple Notes has that the note-taking app should consider building in.\nSecure notes\nApple Notes added the functionality of having secure notes in a recent update, meaning that in order to access notes you deem private it requires either a passcode you set or Touch ID (Face ID for iPhone X).\nWhile this was never something I used because I put my secure notes in 1Password, I do see the importance of having this option. Whether it is you banking information or just a Christmas Gift list you don’t want anyone to stumble upon on accident, the ability to thwart any snooping eyes with this added security is important.\nI am not sure whether Bear hasn’t implemented this because of limitation in what Apple allows users to use (which I doubt because this kind of security is used for password managing apps all the time) or it simply isn’t something that the developer have pushed out yet.\nIf it is the latter, BEar needs to make the effort to make this a reality, security is a growing concern among Apple users every single day, and one way to retain your current users, and probably gain new users, is with this option.\nDocument scans\nSometimes when you are working with others or even for yourself, there are times when you get physical items like contracts and information you want to keep for “future you.” If you are like me, you try and go paperless as much as possible.\nSadly, Bear doesn’t have any kind of document scanning app like that of Apple Notes as of iOS 11. Granted, you can use 3rd party apps to make this happen, but going from one app to another just to keep a contract on hold for later can be a dealbreaker to some. If Bear were to implement this feature, it would dramatically improve some people’s workflows and allow them to make the complete switch over.\nFinal Thoughts\nBear is a colossal giant among note-taking apps and after getting deep int the application making the switch over was one of the best things I have ever done for personal productivity and keeping my thoughts organized.\nyou can download Bear for free, but I recommend going Pro early on for either $1.49 a month or $15.00 a year. The features you get when upgrading can be explained on Bear’s pricing page.\nDid I miss something in this article or have any corrections?

      title: "10 iPad Life Hacks",
      category: null,
      content: "When you are working with your iPad, many people feel stuck. Some feel like they aren&rsquo;t being efficient enough or doing the right things. Well, today we have 10 ipad life hacks on how to get more out of your favorite iPad.\n1. Type to Siri\nType to Siri is a new addition to iOS 11. And if you are like so many others, you usually have a keyboard attached or connected to the iPad. So, instead of talking to Siri you can type to her (or him).\nThis is great for the people who aren&rsquo;t into talking to a computer to do tasks, it is also great for those night owls who don&rsquo;t want to wake anyone that may be sleeping in your home.\nGive type to Siri a try, it may just be the extra kick you need to getting things out of your head and into a system you trust.\nTo do this go into Settings &gt; General &gt; Accessibility &gt; Siri\nFrom there turn on Type to Siri.\n\n2. Have a shelf app in Slide-Over\n\nI spoke about Shelf Apps before. They are a great way to put things you want to save and use in other apps for later. One trick I found to be immensely helpful it to always have it available with a simple swipe from the right side of the iPad.\nThis is called the Slide-Over app. It is basically a floating app that isn&rsquo;t connected to another app, allowing it to be freely accessible wherever you are on you iPad.\nI use this a lot with the images to my posts, but I have seen others use it for practically any type of file or input.\nIf you are looking for a good Shelf app I recommend Gladys or Yoink. Each have their quirks but they are both very powerful and definitely something I keep in my dock for frequent use.\n3. Use Spotlight for searching more than just apps\n\nSpotlight is underutilized, in my opinion, when it comes to using the iPad. Many just use it for the occasional search for an app, but there are so many other things that Spotlight can search for.\nYou can search for files, websites, and even local stores through Maps. Spotlight is something I underutilized until I started pushing to see what all it can handle. I was beyond pleasantly surprised to see that it managed to find what I wanted a large majority of the time.\nGranted, there are times where I couldn&rsquo;t find what I was searching for but that happened far less then when it worked.\nGive Spotlight a try more and see it it works for you.\n4. Edit your Share sheet\nThe Share Sheet is the place to send things from one app to another. But sometimes you have to dig through to find the right app to send the information or file to.\nOne thing you can do is remove the apps you never use in the Share Sheet. You can do this by hitting the share icon and scrolling all the way to the right and tap the &ldquo;More&rdquo; button.\n\nFrom there you can rearrange, hide, or add the apps you want. This works for both the top and bottom rows of the Share Sheet.\nAdditionally, you can drag icons to rearrange them if you find you want one more readily accessible.\n5. Use text shortcuts and/or TextExpander\n\nMany of us have common phrases or information we send to people regularly. Things like email addresses, updates on where we are, or just emails we send when someone asks a question you get asked a lot. This is where Text Replacement and TextExpander come in.\nText Replacement is a feature built into iOS. To see it go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Keyboard and you will see the option there. Once you open it you can add or edit text replacements. One you may see there is omw. What this means is that any time you type &ldquo;omw&rdquo; iOS will replace that with &ldquo;On my way!&rdquo;\nText Replacement is useful for quick phrases or words that you may use a lot, but when you add longer strands of text or need something that is Rick Text, you will need TextExpander.\nTextExpander is a great tool I recommend to anyone who does email support, communicates to others via email or text as part of their job, or just someone that is geeky like my and wants to make things easier for me in the long run.\nBecause of the robust features TextExpander offer you may need some help getting over the learning curve of it. David Sparks did a video series on Textexpander a little over a year ago when the company redesigned their app from the ground up. If you want to learn more about the vast amount of features this app has, David is the man to teach you.\n6. Edit Control Center\n\nControl Center is one of those features that if you use it, it can make things much more efficient and change the way you use your iPhone or iPad.\nWhen iOS 11 came out Apple put together a slew of options you can set for your Control Center, including having up to 8 button instead of the default 4. There are some great options on there, my personal favorite is the screen recording option. With this you just tap on the button and you screen is then being recorded. This is especially handy when you are the tech support person for your family and a relative asks you how to do something on their phone. Instead of walking them through it with long texts or emails you can record how to do it and send it their way to view as many times as they need to accomplish what they want.\n7. Schedule Do Not Disturb times for working on the high-energy level tasks\n\nDo Not Disturb sounds like a feature you would use when you are going to sleep or when you&rsquo;re at the movies, but this feature can cut distractions out of your life big time.\nI use DND when I am writing or working on other high-energy tasks that require my full attention. It saves me from being distracted by email, messages, and more when I am in deep work mode.\nIf you want to learn more about what Do Not Disturb is, Apple has a great support doc to read over.\n8. Long Press on some Apps for a force-touch like response\n\nWhile the new iPhones have Force Touch, the iPad does not. Regardless of the reasoning from Apple, there is a way to get the added pop-ups on an iPad.\nThis doesn&rsquo;t work for all apps that have force touch support, but those that do have it allows you to use it without having to open the app.\nJust tap and hold on an app, instead of it wiggling a pop-up will appear with whatever the developers built to come up. For instance, Apple&rsquo;s Files app shows the most recent documents you have opened, which can be handy when you need to quickly open up something you were working on earlier.\n9. Scan QR codes with your Camera\n\nQR codes were never the smash hit they were meant to be. Rarely do I ever use it, but on the rare occasion I do I always thought you needed to download a separate app. Instead, you have a QR code reader built in to the camera.\nWith a few taps in settings you too can turn on QR Code reader and have the option to scan one within the native Camera app.\nApparently this feature was added with iOS 11. It is a hidden feature to many, but this is so convenient when necessary.\n10. Access Saved Passwords in Safari\n\nPassword management has become more and more important over the years. Between hacks to your email, or even your personal finance information, a good password that is unique on each site is a must.\nSafari has made some major improvements to creating passwords for accounts you make in the browser, making them uniques and then saving them to iCloud.\nBut there are times where you need that password and iOS doesn&rsquo;t have it as an option in the shortcut menu. You&rsquo;re not out of luck, you just need to copy it from Settings.\nTo do this go to Settings &gt; Accounts &amp; Passwords then tap on the App &amp; Website Passwords option at the top. From there you will get access to all the saved passwords in you iCloud Keychain.\nWhile the iCloud Keychain can get the job done it doesn&rsquo;t offer many options for other things like secure notes, and getting to these passwords can be tedious over time.\nThis is where apps like 1Password come in and they offer a great app that can be built into the Share Sheet and is integrated in may apps like Twitter where you jut tap on the lock button in the login screen and it will search for passwords that match Twitter. It is a very intuitive app and well worth the money to ease the stresses of password management and security.\nExtras\nSo there are some life hacks for using you iPhone or iPad. Let me know in the comments or on Twitter if we missed something.\nAlso, if you&rsquo;re wondering how I made these screenshot annotations, I used the app Annotable. They are not a sponsor, just a very cool app and one I want to share with you all!\n",

      category: null,
      content: "If you are wanting to leave your laptop behind for the more portable, convenient, and just pleasant experience that is iOS there is one way to make this transition stick, and it isn&rsquo;t what you think. The best way is to remove all other options and only have an iPad available. It may sound simple, but when you limit yourself innovation takes over. This by no means is easy, but it is the best in my opinion. There is somewhat of a learning curve needed to acclimate yourself.\nTo help you decide if this is right for you, I have come up with 3 things you need to consider when making the conscious choice to leave Mac or PC behind and go iOS only.\n\nAre You Willing to Change Workflows?\n\nMaking this change in your workflows will create some hurdles you may not have had to get over before. But know this, it is possible to use iOS exclusively. To do this you need to know what to do to combat issues that may come up. For that I have a few posts that will help when getting started.\n\niCab Mobile - The Best Browser for iPad\nWhy iPad vs Mac\nLearn How to Use Workflow\n\nI have been using my iPad as my main computer for almost a year and it has become more fluid and second-nature to do nearly everything I could on my Mac. Some things are a little less intuitive but other things I used to do on my Mac seem like they were actually meant for iOS in the first place.\nAll in all, for me, iOS has made my workflows more intentional and effective than they were on the Mac.\n\nHow Important is Automation to You?\n\nBetween Applescripts, applications like Hazel, and other automation options you may be using, iOS is a much more sandboxed experience. This may sound like a bad thing to you, it was for me when I started. But here&rsquo;s how I think of it now: iOS makes you focus more on what is important.\nNow, automation is available for iOS. There is an app called Workflow that Apple acquired last year. It provides the bridges to our apps that we needed, but doesn&rsquo;t run in the background like Hazel or other software can.\nAutomation for iOS isn&rsquo;t the same as Mac, not by a long shot, but it doesn&rsquo;t need to be. I have found the limitations brought to me with iOS automation has actually improved my abilities to work on the things that matter and let the rest fall to the wayside without much hesitation. This is one of the biggest reasons I moved to iOS more and more over the years and why I keep coming back in times of doubt.\n\nDo You Enjoy Trying New Things?\n\nWhen I made the switch to iOS, I made the decision to start right from the bottom and leave all my previous notions of computing at the virtual doorstep. I wanted a clear head and an open-mind when I took this plunge.\nI am not going to lie, there were times when I went back to my Mac, but even when I caved a little I kept remembering all the things that were fun and delightful on my iPad over my Mac and I kept coming back because of it.\nI have learned a ton about iOS and about myself through the last year when I started this journey. I feel like I know how I prefer my work done more than I did before, and I spend less time problem solving and more time actually doing. If I hadn&rsquo;t made that switch to my iPad Air 2 when I did I don&rsquo;t think I would be as confident in my work as I am now and definitely not as productive.\nThe iPad offered me what no other computer did: purpose.\nSo You Want to Use Your iPad More, What Now?\nIf you have considered the pros and cons for you and want to go all-in on iOS, then I have good news! You can join others in a Facebook Group called The iPad Only Club.\nHere you will find me and other like-minded people in the iOS only community that will help you with your problems, encourage you when you are frustrated, and provide useful insight and value to help you make this switch as painless, and dare I say fun as possible.\nIf you want to join, head over to iPadOnly.club and join. It will redirect you to the Facebook group, from there request to join (the reason we require your request is to keep spammers out, don&rsquo;t worry we will accept your request).\nThere may not be many users on there yet (this is the launch announcement after all), but I will be there every day to help you and encourage you throughout this change as the group grows over time. And if you want more people to join, share this with them. They say the best way to do anything life-changing is with a friend.\nSo, if you are looking to make the switch it iOS as your main operating system join The iPad Only Club over at iPadOnly.club.\nSee you there.\n",

      content: "Ina Fried from Axios posted an article stirring the pot for the iOS community. In part Fried explains that iOS 12 may be more of a refinement update and less feature-rich than past updates.\n\nApple has shaken up its iOS software plans for 2018, delaying some features to next year in an effort to put more focus on addressing performance and quality issues, Axios has learned.\n\nFried goes on to say that this is coming from Craig Federighi in a meeting with employees.\nAfter this report was published Dan Moren posted his thoughts on Six Colors\n\n... any major software release is all about prioritization, and I&rsquo;m sure Apple has done the math of balancing new features vs. optimization pretty much every year. It may just be a matter of seeing behind the curtain this time around, combined with the context of the recent situations that Apple&rsquo;s found itself in that makes this seem more significant. But it&rsquo;s hard to say because, again, Apple tends to keep its hand pretty close to its vest.\n\nIn short: this is probably no cause for either panic or jubilation.\nPersonally, I couldn&rsquo;t agree more with Dan Moren, this &ldquo;scoop&rdquo; seems to be legitimate and very well may be true. However, I don&rsquo;t think this is necessarily something that warrants panic or worry for iOS users.\nNick Heer of Pixel Envy also I had a great point in regards to this &ldquo;Snow Leopard for iOS&rdquo; rumors:\n\nWhile High Sierra experienced a couple of fairly\nserious security\nvulnerabilities and has its share of\nirritating bugs\n, Snow Leopard &mdash; the go-to example of a refinement-oriented release &mdash; wasn&rsquo;t exactly immune. It shipped with a bug that sometimes\nwiped user\ndata after logging into a guest account, a bug which took\nmonths to fix\n; and,\nlike High Sierra\n, Snow Leopard experienced a\ntext rendering bug\nas well. We should hope software gets better over time, of course, but you can look back at every single new version of MacOS and find bugs that categorically should not have shipped. I don&rsquo;t expect the next version of iOS &mdash; or MacOS, for that matter &mdash; to be an exception, but I hope it is.\n\nWe are still several months away from WWDC and this is only the beginning or rumors season, but this isn&rsquo;t one rumor to grab your pitchforks over.\nEspecially for iPad users, iOS 11 was leaps and bounds ahead of where iOS 10 was with features. Things were upgraded to be more user friendly, we got the Dock that allowed multitasking to be more fluid, and hardware to go with the new version of iOS to boot.\n2017 was a great year to be an iOS user and if 2018 is more of a &ldquo;toc&rdquo; instead of a &ldquo;tick&rdquo; to allow for Apple to make things better and less buggy, so be it.\n",

      title: "PencilSnap Review",
      category: null,
      content: "The Apple Pencil is a great tool when you need it, but when you don&rsquo;t it can be more of an inconvenience than anything. This is why there are so many Pencil cases and products to allow you to store the pencil when you don&rsquo;t need it.\nApple joined this game last year with their own case. But there was one problem: it provided no function for transporting it. To do that you would need to buy Apple&rsquo;s $129.00 leather sleeve. I don&rsquo;t know about you, but if I have to buy something that costs more than my Apple Pencil to just keep it near my iPad it isn&rsquo;t for me. With that out as an option, I still needed a sleek, high functioning holster for my Pencil.\nThis is where Twelve South&nbsp;comes in with their new product, the PencilSnap\nI recently bought my own PencilSnap to see if this would be the final accessory I would need to carry my Apple Pencil once and for all. I have to say, this little piece of leather has a lot going for it.\nLook and Feel\nThis holster is very minimal looking and there is no noticeable branding on the product at first glance. However, If you look on the back of it where there are magnets to stick it on a Smart Cover to Smart Keyboard you can see the word PencilSnap embossed on the leather. It is a very subtle but nice touch that is something I wish other brands would do on their products.\n\nThe leather the PencilSnap is made out of is well crafted to say the least. It has the feel of fresh leather you would get from an Apple branded iPhone case. I haven&rsquo;t had it long enough to see how this leather ages over time but if the photos I see of leather iPhone cases on Reddit indicates anything, it is going to look even better after some time and use. I will say that it takes a few time of putting it in and taking the Apple Pencil out for the leather to loosen up. Honestly this was fine after about a dozen time of me taking it out.\nThe backing with the magnets is firm but mailable enough to really allow you to pull your pencil in an out without worrying that you are going to break the case. It also bounces back very nicely, leaving my worries of it being forever bent backwards behind.\nFunctionality\nThis thing is crazy strong. Both with the magnets keeping it on the iPad and the overall casing for the Pencil. I have vigorously shaken the case with the pencil in it and it just doesn&rsquo;t budge. the PencilSnap does its job well and without any margin of error.\nI also have had the case on my iPad 10.5&rdquo; Smart Keyboard and took a shake to that as well, way more than I would actually jostle my iPad in day-to-day use. Again, not a single budge. I wanted to see just how far I had to take things in order to get these magnets to fail.\nSo I removed the Smart Keyboard from my iPad and unfurled it to have one long silicone case and a keyboard and shook it like a mad man. Finally, after a few good shakes the force of the case whipping back and forth made it fly off the case. So if you end up whipping your Smart Cover around like it&rsquo;s a bed sheet, this magnet won&rsquo;t work. But if you aren&rsquo;t insane, and you treat your tablet with even a little respect this thing won&rsquo;t fail on you.\nIf I find any issues with this over time I will be sure to update this post and let you know, but honestly I don&rsquo;t foresee me having to do that. I am utterly impressed with just how sleek yet strong Twelve South made this.\nConclusion\nIf you aren&rsquo;t satisfied with how you are using your Apple Pencil for travel or just want something to keep your Apple Pencil with your iPad Pro, this $30 accessory will be the only thing you need. It keeps it close to your iPad and safely attached. I would recommend this over Apple&rsquo;s case, or really any other Apple Pencil case, with zero hesitation.\nTwelve South continues to uphold their reputation as one of the leading Apple accessory manufacturers because they sweat the details, and make sure products like the PencilSnap make your life easier and look great too.\nYou can pick up your own PencilSnap at Twelve South&rsquo;s website for just $1 more than Apple&rsquo;s and get ten times more use out of it.\n",

      title: "Minimal iPad: 2 Weeks Later",
      category: null,
      content: "When I started this minimalism challenge I said that I was overwhelmed, and that was one of the main reasons I decided to make a change. After 2 weeks I can say that my overwhelm has subsided some, but not all.\nI was expecting this to be like lifting all the weight I had on my shoulders off in one fell swoop but that was not the case. I think i was a little naive with that idea, of course there isn&rsquo;t an easy way to reduce stress in your life. If there was, everyone would be doing it!\nAfter some time in this challenge I noticed a few patterns that I want to share with you.\nMy iPhone seems to collect more apps than my iPad\nEveryone reading this probably isn&rsquo;t surprised by this statement, I wasn&rsquo;t surprised either. It is obvious that the device I use the most would have a larger net to cast when fishing for apps. Plus, my iPhone is more of a technological Swiss Army Knife while my iPad is primarily for writing, editing, and other administration work for Tablet Habit and Getting Caught Up. I use the two devices differently and my phone is more convenient to track when my packages are going to arrive with Deliveries and handling my music and podcasts. To be honest, there really isn&rsquo;t much overlap between my iPhone and iPad. They seem to be on their own islands.\nIn total, I would guess that I have downloaded twice as many apps in the past two weeks than my iPad. I wish I was more cognizant of keeping track of what apps I downloaded to which device, that way I could give you the nitty-gritty statistics. Sadly, that isn&rsquo;t the case.\nSafari Still Distracts Me\nAnother big reason I decided to removed everything from my devices was to have less distractions and allow myself to focus more. One of my biggest distractions is YouTube. I consume YouTube more than Netflix, Hulu, and Cable combined. YouTube is my sanctuary of video content and has been for years. However, I noticed several months ago that it began to be a place I went to when I was procrastinating from writing or hammering out a big project for one of my areas (Tablet Habit, Getting Caught Up, or freelance podcast editing). Something needed to change, so I deleted that app off my devices entirely.\nMy plan was that if I only watched YouTube within Safari I would be adding those extra steps to get to it that I would have time to rethink my choice and instead go back to working on something more productive, I was wrong. I almost immediately saved YouTube as a Favorite in Safari so it was just a tap away every time I opened the app. It was just there, staring me in the face begging for me to press it. Much like the sailors in the poem The Odyssey by Homer I was being lured by the Sirens towards shipwreck, or in this case opened a browser.\nI haven&rsquo;t been noticing a huge difference in my output\nFinally, I thought that this experiment would relieve friction to allow me to produce more content and have less decisions to make. The complete opposite happened in this department. I did find myself with less friction from my devices thank to no apps to immediately shut my brain off, but I was still not producing more content. I was finding myself contemplating and battling with myself on decisions on where to go next. It got a bit existential for a bit, but the main bread and butter of what was bothering me was that even when I didn&rsquo;t have any excuses to write more, I still found myself making excuses.\nWhile this was all going on I took to Twitter to try and get my mind off things and that was when I saw this.\n[twitter.com/BRIANMBEN...](https://twitter.com/BRIANMBENDIS/status/950123894022619136)\nThis is a tweet by the famous comic book writer Brian Michael Bendis. If you don&rsquo;t know who he is, that&rsquo;s fine (I will say if you want to get more into comics listen to the podcast I Read Comic Books). Just know he is an accomplished writer with decades of work and several awards to prove it. The message he says here saying that writing never gets any easier helped me realize that no matter how focused I am or how many apps I don&rsquo;t have on my devices it is entirely up to me to make the words come on to a page. Not the app, not the writing gods, 100% unequivocally me. That is refreshing, incredibly daunting, but also refreshing. The mountains I plan to climb are tall and the terrain is less than ideal but I need to make the first step towards it, otherwise what&rsquo;s the point?\nThe Light at the End of the Tunnel\nI know I have unpacked a lot of things that didn&rsquo;t work or even just some personal things that might not necessarily be your experience, but even with these discoveries I think this is working in many ways. I will go into those more once I finish out the month but until then I will say that this looks like it was absolutely worth doing and it allows me to learn more about myself than before, which wasn&rsquo;t necessarily my goal but it is something that can help me long-term.\nWhat&rsquo;s next?\nAt the end of the month I will have more to say about what worked and my overall thoughts on this challenge as well. I have noticed a lot in the last couple of weeks but I still there think there is more to uncover about myself and what I use my devices for. I plan to see this through the month of January at the very least and then completely assess where I stand on this. Until then though I do want to change one thing: being more intentional with my writing and making time to do it every single day.\n",

      title: "Why iPad vs Mac",
      category: null,
      content: "I love my iPad, so much so that I created a blog for it. It&rsquo;s clear that I talk a lot about how to use an iPad as a &ldquo;laptop replacement&ldquo;&rdquo; but I never have gone into why I chose to do this.\nTo explain this there are two schools of thought, one being why I personally chose this and then the reasons that can be universal to everyone.\nPersonal Reasons\nFederico Viticci really changed how I looked at the iPad and is one of the biggest reasons I picked up my iPad for something other than Netflix and YouTube. It all started with him and his blog MacStories and his story of how while he was battling cancer he found a way to write on his blog with the iPad. This lead to him finding ways to use that device for everything he did. Knowing how someone can turn this big slab of glass into a work horse of a machine-made me really rethink of what you need from a computer, even what a computer actually was.\nFrom there it was my curiosity and persistence to throw everything I could at these machines to see what stuck and what didn&rsquo;t. To continue with the spaghetti metaphor, I found most of what I threw at the wall stuck.\nI needed a machine that can handle multiple areas of my life: podcasting, writing, and the occasional image editing. All three of these things were handled in some capacity or another, some with less friction, and others with more. No matter the obstacles I had to hurdle there was a solution to allow me to use this tablet as my main machine, and that was easily the hard part of the battle. I was able to store my laptop away from my desk and accomplish everything I wanted with just my iPad Air 2, and now my iPad Pro.\nBut my personal reasons are just a portion of why I use the iPad. I also have some more general reasons that I think goes further than just my personal journey.\nGeneral Reasons\nMy personal reasons were much more intimate, but for the general reasons I wanted to list them out and just show how many reasons there are for me, and possibly you, to use an iPad over any other computer.\nPortability\nHaving the ability to carry a tablet that weighs light enough to hold as a book in my hand-made even my MacBook Air seems cumbersome. The iPad is the epitome of a portable computer and having to take my computer with me to work and other places regularly this meant my bag was getting a lot lighter.\nEase of Use\nDavid Sparks of MacSparky has said before that working on the iPad such a &ldquo;delight.&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t agree more with him in the regard. Something about being able to move things with your fingers directly on-screen is much more satisfying than using a trackpad on any Mac. It felt like the future when I can actually move a piece of text or part of an image with the tips of my fingers.\nThere is also something special with the Apple Pencil as an input device. I know there are things you can buy to use a stylus with a computer but The Apple Pencil has no frills or hiccups because it is an Apple product for Apple devices. The Apple Pencil isn&rsquo;t something I use all the time but when I do I am elated to have it. I jot notes down with it, markup PDFs, even just use to fight RSI when I get cramps on my hands. I posted some other reasons to use an Apple Pencil as well if you're considering getting one.&nbsp;\nBattery Life\nCharging my Macbook was a given when I decided to take it outside my desk, which meant that I also needed to find a place to do my work that had an outlet readily available. Finding a place to work that also has seating at or near an electrical outlet made my goal to find somewhere to work outside my home very undesirable.\niOS Software\nDevelopment for iOS is on a much more secure foundation than macOS is in my opinion. Buying a Mac App isn&rsquo;t as easy as a one-stop shop that is the iTunes Store. The Mac App Store has had its issues over the past several years and it doesn&rsquo;t look like there is a light at the end of the tunnel just yet.\nAbility to Focus\nOne of the big reasons I love the iPad is because it allows me to focus on what matters. With a Mac or PC of any kind it is way too easy to have your writing app next to a YouTube video or search for things and go down a Wikipedia rabbit hole. With only having just one or two apps up and nothing else in the way I can find ways to focus on the things that matter.\nConclusion\nSo there are a plethora of reasons for me to love the iPad, but this is more about why&nbsp;you love the iPad. I hope these reasons helped explain that. If I missed something or you would like to add to this feel free to comment below!\n",

      content: "Just after Christmas I always feel overwhelmed. Overwhelmed with packing my gifts away, overwhelmed with decompressing after being &ldquo;on&rdquo; throughout the holiday season, and overwhelmed with the amount of things I have to do to get the new year &ldquo;started right.&rdquo;\nI always have the need to clean up my life towards the end of the year, both physically and mentally, so that I go into the new year with the right mindset and the best possible workstation I can make for myself.\nThe problem is I very quickly find that I am not able to keep track of everything I need to do and my desk seems more like a storage unit in an episode of Hoarders.\nThis month I want to change that, I want to stick to keeping my tasks and things I want to do in order. I want to have a space dedicated to my writing at my home. If you&rsquo;re asking yourself why I suddenly have a fire lit under me about doing this, the answer is simple.\nWhy I am Doing this\nThe big reason I am doing this is because of a documentary called Minimalist: A Documentary About the Important Things that opened my eyes about minimalism and about compulsory shopping. The main message was that we simply don&rsquo;t need as much stuff as we think we do.\nI don&rsquo;t think I will be as minimal as the two main subjects in the documentary but I do think a change is needed in my life because I simply feel overrun when I have too many things on my desk, in my closet, and in my living space.\nSo the documentary got me interested with minimalism but the message is what had me take action. And the action I&rsquo;ve taken so far has been very uplifting.\nI decided the first thing I wanted to do with my life to minimize the things I needed was with my desk. Before I started this I had a desk drawer filled to the brim with things I habitually threw in there when I thought I would need it someday but not today. The three drawers I had contained things like 4 pairs of nail clippers, keyboards I no longer used, and a small office worth of disposable pens to name a few. Shocker: I didn&rsquo;t need any of them now.\nSo I decided to start emptying out the drawers and see with it was that I actually needed. The answer was none of it. I had a dedicated fountain pen on my Bullet Journal for journaling, I had a Smart Keyboard on my iPad for writing, and everything else I need was in my to-go bag I take with me everywhere. The drawers held items that did not need to stay with me. So I packed it away in storage and everything I need in my life day-to-day is either on my desk or in my bag at arms reach.\nThe feeling of serenity and the weight I felt lifting off my shoulders as I closed my storage closet was something I did not expect, and I wanted to continue this. Minimalism was working, and I began thinking about how I use my iPhone and iPad and the apps that cluttered them.\nWhich leads me to the challenge I am going to take in the month of January.\nWhat I am doing\nThe challenge for this is simple: start with the stock apps you get when getting a new device and only download the apps you need and leave the rest behind. Now, there are some rules to this challenge I am setting myself as well to keep me on track and preventing myself from clutter on my devices\n\nDelete any app you don&rsquo;t use after 48 hours of downloading.\n\n\nIf I need that app again for whatever reason I can always re-download it, but the point of this challenge is to have only the essentials. Apps I don&rsquo;t use after 2 days its initial use are no longer considered essential for me.\n\n\nHave everything on one screen\n\n\nthe main reason for this is because if I limit myself to one screen it leaves me having to really think about what is worth the space on my screen.\nThere are a lot of stock apps I simply don&rsquo;t need and they can be pushed back in a folder to stay out of sight and refrain from taking up my precious screen real estate.\n\n\nDocument in a journal your feelings and changes every day for the next 3 weeks\n\n\nDoing this challenge and not keeping track of the changes and my feelings on this is hardly a challenge at all. For every experiment there has to be documented analysis for this and daily journaling is something I think will provide that.\n\nNow that these rules are set, all that is left is actually doing this.\nWhat&rsquo;s Next\nWith the challenge and the time frame set all that is left is action and analysis.\nSo for the next week I will be writing in my journal once a day about the feelings I have and the changes that happens with it. Once the week is over I will report back on January 8th to check in. I will do this every week and come back at the end of the month with my thoughts, information on how things went, and anything I would do differently if I did this again.\nSo for now I am left with an empty desk, an iPhone and iPad reset, and nothing but 21 days of essential apps to use.\n",

With three different iPads out on sale from Apple today, to call the market divided would be an understatement.\nWhen I first wrote for this blog I posted a story about how I used the Logitech Slim Combo for my 10.5&rdquo; iPad Pro. I said that the key travel and features like backlighting and media buttons were the reason why I chose it over the Apple Smart Keyboard. I also took some shots at the keys on the Smart Keyboard and the material on it. I was wrong. The Logitech Keyboard has since lost its varnish and the Apple Smart Keyboard is growing on me.\nI purchased the Apple Smart Keyboard again earlier this week because I found myself hating having to use the bulky Slim Combo. I also was using my keyboard more on my couch and less on a desk. Using Logitech&rsquo;s keyboard on my lap was like balancing china plates to get that keyboard to work for me outside of a desk setting.\nFinally, the keys never felt right for my hands. This is the most problematic issue for me because if I can&rsquo;t write properly then my brain will just tell me not to write at all. After leaving my iPad after writing a few hundred words to make food or use the bathroom, I noticed my hands needed to have an adjustment period from using the Slim Combo. This was very concerning because I felt like I was in the midst of an RSI issue. If my hands hurt when using a tool specifically made for writing then I need a new tool.\nThe Apple Smart Keyboard was my only option because of what I deemed necessary on a keyboard. I wanted something that was attachable to the iPad, portable, and used the smart connectors to power the device. Once I realized the Apple Smart Keyboard was the next plausible option, I took the plunge and tried this keyboard out one last time. I&rsquo;m glad I did.\nWriting on this after spending months with the Slim Combo feels like my hands can breathe and I have never had more relaxed hands when typing for a long time. I was worried about the key travel and if I would be able to write with them, but that has been the easiest part about using this keyboard. The main keys on this device are where you would think they are and the chiclet style keys are a welcome change to the cramped keys Logitech put together.\nThe thing that I found to be the most difficult to get used to is that fact this stand only had 3 positions: the traditional keyboard setup, the keyboard folded over for watching videos, and the usual setup where the keyboard is resting on the tri-fold to be used for playing games. Going from pretty much any conceivable angle with he adjustable stand Logitech had to only three options, all with different uses felt constraining.\nI really miss the adjustable hinge on the back of the Slim Combo, it was great for when I wanted to watch a YouTube video or an episode of television on Netflix. I could set it anywhere I wanted and find an angle that worked for me to view it.\nI haven&rsquo;t watched much on my iPad since buying this but the times I did for the purposed of this review it wasn&rsquo;t the perfect viewing angle but I adjusted just fine with it. I often found myself just using it in the keyboard position because of how small the footprint this case provides when compared to the Logitech Slim Combo.\nAll in all this keyboard isn&rsquo;t perfect, but no keyboard is. It seems to be the best option for my plethora of prerequisites. The Logitech Slim Combo is still a great option for many, just not for me.\nIf you are in the market for a keyboard and find yourself trying to figure out which of these two is best for you I would buy it from a store that offers at lease a 14 day return policy and try each out before you make your final purchase. I did this, but I didn&rsquo;t give the Apple Smart Keyboard enough time as I probably should have. If I had, then I probably wouldn&rsquo;t be in the position I am in now.\n",

      title: "3 Ways to Stay Focused on Your iPad",
      category: null,
      content: "Many people, like myself, work on an iPad because they love iOS and prefer it over macOS or Windows. They also do it because it inherently makes you focus on one or two applications at a time, leaving distractions behind.However, the human brain is great at finding things you can do to procrastinate from getting things done. If your main machine is an iPad, chances are you don&rsquo;t just have apps for your work on it. You probably have streaming services, music, games, and more to occupy your free time; but what if you find yourself using those apps instead of doing your important work? Today we are going to look at that and see what options there are to limit this kind of behavior.\n1. Delete Unnecessary Apps\nThe simplest solution could be to remove the distractions entirely. Delete the YouTube app, the games, music and anything else you catch yourself using instead using doing the work that matters.\nThis can be great for people who live by the mantra &ldquo;out of sight, out of mind.&rdquo; However, this can&rsquo;t always be accomplished because we want to use these apps when we&rsquo;re not doing work and downloading those apps over and over again when we want them is too much of a hassle. If this is the case for you the next option could be what you need.\n2. Move Them to a Different Page on the Home Screen\nIf you do find yourself needing to keep apps like YouTube, VLC, Twitter, etc. for various reasons you can still keep them &ldquo;out of sight&rdquo; by having it on a separate home screen.\nThis not only allows you to keep the apps for luxury time, but it also puts that barrier up so you have to tell yourself that you are going to this page because you want to do something that is meant for free time.\nI am a big on the idea of having different areas on your devices for different goals you want to accomplish, so this is one I recommend to many.\nBut what if you aren&rsquo;t too keen on the idea of having a second page on the home screen? Then look not further than the next option you have.\n3. Nest Them all in a Folder\nIf you are one of those types of people who hate a second page on their home screen (like me) you can still keep those distracting apps on the home screen but as its own folder tucked away for when you need those breaks from the hustle and bustle of work.\nI suggest naming the folder something that reminds you what you&rsquo;re doing to yourself if you decide to go rogue on your big plans of work for the day. This is why I have a folder called &ldquo;Time Waste.&rdquo;\nThe name can be anything you want but I recommend it be something that your brain will recognize as something you shouldn&rsquo;t be doing when you have something on your to-do list that needs to be done.\n\nSo if you are like many and mix between work and play on your iPad these tricks can help you stay focused to the tasks at hand.\nLet us know what you think, or share your own tips to stay focused on the iPad, in the comments below!\n",

      content: "Configuration\nAll configuration options are in the _config.yml file.\n\n\n    \n    Created by Hannah Sharp\n\n\nGeneral Settings\n\n  name: Your name.\n  job_title: Your job title.\n  email: Your email. There are two cases where email is used. First, if you entered the email and you’ve activated show_email option the end result will be a visible social email icon in the sidebar. The second use of your email is when you do not set your own avatar. In this case your email is used by the gravatar plugin to automatically fetch your gravatar.\n  description: Describe yourself with a couple of words.\n  avatar: Write down the full path to the avatar http://mysite.com/blog/assets/images/avatar.jpg. If you comment this row, “Steve” checks if you have an email and shows your gravatar if you have any.\n  favicon: Want a favicon? Enter the full path here. For example http://mysite.com/blog/assets/favicon.ico.\n  twitter_handler: Add your Twitter username without the @. It will be used for Twitter Cards. The default card type for “Steve” is Summary Card with Large Image.\n  analytics_code: Add your Google Analytics Tracking ID. Example ID: UA-XXXXXXX-2.\n  disqus: Add your website shortname from Disqus.\n\n\nImportant Note: Keep in mind that name, job_title, twitter_handler and some of the post specific variables are used as default meta data in some cases.\n\n\n\nSocial Accounts\n\n  social_networks: Here you can find the list of all the available social networks that you can currently use. Of course you can always add a new one by yourself or ask for it to be available in the next version of the theme. If you don’t want a specific social network to be seen, just leave the url value empty or delete the line.\n\n\nImportant: Do not change the names of the social networks!\n\nModules Settings\nOne thing to remember - 1 is on, 0 is off.\n\n\n  show_categories: If it is on and you’ve added categories in the post itself the categories will be visible. If it is off and you’ve added categories in the post they will be hidden. This option is helpful if you want to turn on/off categories for all your posts at once.\n  show_tags: If it is on and you’ve added tags in the post itself the tags will be visible. If it is off and you’ve added tags in the post they will be hidden.  This option is helpful if you want to turn on/off tags for all your posts at once.\n  show_email: If this is turned on and you’ve entered an email value in email, an email icon will appear next to your social media accounts and all your readers will be able to contact you.\n  show_rss: If this is turned on, a new RSS button will appear in the sidebar next to your social media accounts.\n  show_comments: If it is on and you’ve added comments: true in the post itself the comments will be visible. If it is off and you’ve added comments: true in the post the comments will be hidden. This option is helpful if you want to turn on/off comments for all your posts at once.\n  show_menu: If it is on the main menu will be visible.\n  fixed_sidebar: If it is on the sidebar will be fixed (sticky).\n\n\nDefaults\n\n  defaults: The only available option at the moment is whether to enable the comments automatically in the post or not. The default value is true.\n\n\nServing\nThese options are pretty important, so take a closer look. If you experience any problems with your paths you should check them here.\n\n\n  url: Enter your domain! Example: https://mysite.com\n  baseurl: The baseurl can remain empty if you’re not going to host your site in a subfolder. But if you want your site to be something like htttp://mysite.com/blog you should write down /blog here.\n\n\nIncludes\n\n\n  include: Force the inclusion of the pages directory.\n\n\nOutputting\n\n\n  permalink: By default your links will look like this http://mysite.com/categories/post-name.html. If you want a different permalink check Jekyll documentation.\n  category_dir: The default directory is categories, so for example if you go to random category index you will see something like this http://mysite.com/categories/category-name/postname.html.\n\n\nPagination\n\n  paginate: You should enter a number that stands for the number of posts per page.\n  paginate_path: The default path is /page:num/, so for example if you go to second page you will see something like this http://mysite.com/page2/.\n\n\nImportant Note: Pagination is currently working only on home page due to Jekyll limitations.\n\nConversion\n\n  markdown: Choose your Markdown renderer. Different Markdown renderers supported by Jekyll sometimes have extra options available. I suggest to stick with the default.\n  excerpt_separator: By default when you’re writing a post, you should add &lt;!--more--&gt; to define excerpt. You have three options - to leave it as is, to change the tag or to completely remove it but in this case you’ll always see the full content.\n\n\nAssets Settings\n\n  sass: Choose the path to all of yours SCSS partials and the compression method for the final file.\n\n\nIf you need extra help, just check out the official Jekyll documentation.\n\nAdditional Configuration\n\n\n\tHow to change your default theme color?\n\tJust go to /assets/partials/_vars.scss and change the color of the $primary-color variable.\n\t\n\tHow Facebook knows which image to use for sharing?\n\tBy default the script gets the first image in the post so take that in mind when you write a blog post.\n\n\nAdding Post\n\nThe next thing after you are done with the configuration file is to add your first post. You will need to have at least basic knowledge of HTML or Markdown.\n\nAll you need to do is to create a new file with name YYYY-MM-DD-my-first-post and .markdown or .md extension. Create it in the _posts folder. By default the name of the file is composed by date and title but you can overwrite these in the post’s front matter.\n\nIn the beginning of the every post you have a so called front matter block which contains some data about the post. Here is the short description of the options.\n\nlayout: The post layout.\n\ndate: Exact date when the post is published. The date is actually pretty important and I suggest you never change it. Specific date helps Jekyll to order correctly all the posts. Also, the date is used to generate a unique ID, so Disqus can always get the right comments for the right post, even when you change the title.\n\ntitle: Post’s title.\n\ndescription: Meta description used for better SEO.\n\ncomments: By default they are always true, but if you want to turn them off for a specific post just set this to false.\n\ncategory: List the categories in which you want your post to appear.\n\ntags: List your tags here.\n\nAdding Page\n\nAdding page is even simpler than adding post. Just create a sub-folder to the pages directory and inside that sub-folder create index.md file. The folder name is your page name. Every folder must contain index file. Pages are also using front matter to add information to your page.\n\nlayout: The page layout.\n\ntitle: Page’s title.\n\npermalink: This is important. If you do not enter the permalink, your url will be something like this http://example.com/_pages/about. Enter the permalink and get rid of /_pages/ part. Do not forget the trailing slash!\n\nThat’s it! Do not hesitate to ask if you have any questions. Also you can send me feature requests. There are some nice features that are planed for the upcoming versions. Happy blogging!\n",

Once installed you can call jekyll serve in the terminal in a directory and provided that directory is setup in a way jekyll expects, it will do magic stuff like parse markdown/textile files, compute categories, tags, permalinks, and construct your pages from layout templates and partials.\n\nOnce parsed, Jekyll stores the result in a self-contained static _site folder. The intention here is that you can serve all contents in this folder statically from a plain static web-server.\n\nYou can think of Jekyll as a normalish dynamic blog but rather than parsing content, templates, and tags on each request, Jekyll does this once beforehand and caches the entire website in a folder for serving statically.\n\nSource: http://jekyllbootstrap.com/lessons/jekyll-introduction.html\n",

We’ll cover topics such as getting your site up and running, creating and managing your content, customizing the way your site works and looks, deploying to various environments, and give you some advice on participating in the future development of Jekyll itself.\n\nJekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through a converter (like Markdown) and our Liquid renderer, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server. Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind GitHub Pages, which means you can use Jekyll to host your project’s page, blog, or website from GitHub’s servers for free.\n\n\n\t\n\tPhoto by LoboStudio Hamburg.\n\n\nThroughout this guide there are a number of small-but-handy pieces of information that can make using Jekyll easier, more interesting, and less hazardous. Here’s what to look out for.\n\nIf you come across anything along the way that we haven’t covered, or if you know of a tip you think others would find handy, please file an issue and we’ll see about including it in this guide.\n\nThe front matter is where Jekyll starts to get really cool. Any file that contains a YAML front matter block will be processed by Jekyll as a special file. The front matter must be the first thing in the file and must take the form of valid YAML set between triple-dashed lines.\n",
