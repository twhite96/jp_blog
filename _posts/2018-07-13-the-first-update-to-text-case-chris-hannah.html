				<a href="http://blog.chrishannah.me/the-first-update-to-text-case/">The First Update to Text Case – Chris Hannah</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It hasn’t been long since the release of Text Case, but I’ve already had some great suggestions, so I decided to add them in!</p>
<p>So here it goes.</p>
<p>Five extra formats: – URL Decoded – Capitalise All Words – Camel Case – Snake Case – Hashtags</p>
<p>One format has been “fixed”, and that is Capitalise. It now does the obvious and also capitalises the first letter after a period.</p>
<p>You can now choose which formats you want to enable, by navigating to the Settings page, and flipping the switches. This will obviously allow for a more customised interface, as I imagine some people won’t want all 12 formats to show if there aren’t needed.</p>
<p>I still have two things I want to work on. One is the ability for the action extension to be able to replace the original selected text with the new converted value. The other is a pretty great idea that I can’t share until I figure out how exactly I’m going to implement it. But it will be an advanced feature.</p></blockquote>
<p>Chris has been working really hard on Text Case and while it might sound like a simple app, this utility can be quite useful when you are on-the-go and writing out things quickly. I know have had times where I wanted to change the format of the text quickly but not know what to do about it. I have tried building clunky workflows that worked for <em>some</em> things but having this app around is just a delight.</p>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/text-case/id1407730596?mt=8&amp;at=1000lHAf">Give Chris’ app a download</a> and see what you think of it. If you want to make a suggestion, clearly he is listening!		</p>
