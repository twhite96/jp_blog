<p>
				When I started reading <a href="http://gettingthingsdone.com"><em>Getting Things Done</em></a>, I was in a spinning world of chaos. I had many different plates spinning at the same time and no way of making sure that nothing fell through the cracks. I needed a system.</p>
<p>So, as a challenge to both my co-host of <a href="http://aslabofglass.com"><em>A Slab of Glass</em></a>, <a href="http://theuntitledsite.com">Christopher Lawley</a>, and myself I set out to read the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0143126563"><em>Getting Things Done</em> by David Allen</a> cover to cover to see just if GTD was something that would work for me. After chapter one I was all in.</p>
<p>I wanted to use this methodology immediately. I did brain dumps, set up a task manager, and started making boat loads of contexts and tags and folders. I thought I was <strong>finally</strong> getting to where I wanted with a system that worked for me. The reality was that I was on a high setting up all these productivity things, and I was no closer to getting my work done.</p>
<p>If I am being honest, I was even further from getting the big things in my life done. I did all the things I thought I needed to do to get my life in order and start Getting Things Done, but in reality I just took the foundation of the methodology and ran with it, without thinking on a much higher level.</p>
<p>I was worried about having a task manager that handled everything I threw at it, without actually throwing anything at it. I put the cart before the horse, and that is where I think a lot of people end up when starting a brand new productivity system. This all stops now for me.</p>
<p>I have decided that over the next several weeks I will be starting from scratch in Getting Things Done, and do what <a href="http://macsparky.net">David Sparks</a> suggested when he was on <a href="http://aslabofglass.com/19"><em>A Slab of Glass</em> episode 19</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Do not try to create an entire system in a day. I think what you should do is you should make a list of things you want to improve. What are the key elements of a task management system? There&rsquo;s capture, how do you capture tasks? How do you process tasks? How do you complete tasks? How do you review projects? Those are the big 4 steps. And pick one of those and say, &ldquo;How am I going to get better at this?&rdquo; And do that for two weeks, or a month, or two months, or whatever it takes to just internalize that and say, &ldquo;Okay, I am just crushing it on capture, now how am I going to process tasks?&rdquo; If you try to do it all at once it&rsquo;s just overwhelming and nothing sticks. It&rsquo;s just like learning keyboard shortcuts or anything you do. Bite off small pieces and fully digest them. And then take another piece, but don&rsquo;t try to eat the whole elephant in one bite, you&rsquo;re going to have a problem.</p></blockquote>
<p>So the first thing I am going to work on is capturing. I need to figure out a system that will work for me and what will allow me to make capturing thoughts, ideas, projects, tasks, and anything else that comes to mind. I need to make it second nature to take those ideas in my mind and put them somewhere I will go back to later to process them.</p>
<p>All of this will be part of an ongoing series on Tablet Habit I like to call &ldquo;Learning GTD.&rdquo; Capturing will be part one of this new series, and I can&rsquo;t wait to share this journey with all of you as I try to make my life more organized and less chaotic.		</p>
