				One thing I think that was most interesting on the new Apple Event Keynote wasn&rsquo;t <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/october-2018/">the new devices</a>, but the fact that <a href="https://www.apple.com/today/">Today at Apple</a> was given time on stage.</p>
<p>For those that don&rsquo;t know what Today at Apple is, it&rsquo;s a series of workshops that Apple Stores offer for anyone to come to for free and learn things you can do on the Mac, iPad, and iPhone. I am sure there are others as well, but it&rsquo;s been something that hasn&rsquo;t been talked much about in the Apple tech community.</p>
<p>The Today at Apple workshops may not be geared towards those who are tech savvy. With that said, Apple giving time for it on stage today in between the release of some much-needed updates (<a href="https://www.apple.com/mac-mini/">Mac Mini</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>) and interesting innovation (<a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>) shows that Apple isn&rsquo;t just here to make you think that your iPad Pro 10.5&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t good enough anymore. They want you to harness that power with what ever device you have.</p>
<p>As Tim Cook said in the keynote after they announced 60 all-new sessions coming to Apple Stores, it is something that no one else has.</p>
<p>For me personally I have never been to a session, but after today I have been looking at upcoming events and workshops at my local Apple Store and am very seriously considering making the 55 minute drive to go to one of these.</p>
<p>Some sessions mentioned in the Keynote include Siri Shortcuts, and a session called Small Screen Magic which is all about making short movies with the Clips app. They also provided an interesting background with other new sessions that are intriguing to say the least.</p>
<p>Apple really outdid themselves today with the new devices. But I think they equally outdid themselves 18 months ago when they launched Today at Apple and made it possible for their users to learn from the team at Apple just what kind of things they can make on their computers.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that when this part of the Keynote happened the entire audience at the Brooklyn Academy of Music went into an uproar of enthusiasm and excitement. It is indicative just how important sessions like this can be for users, and I can&rsquo;t wait to see what I have been missing out on.		</p>
