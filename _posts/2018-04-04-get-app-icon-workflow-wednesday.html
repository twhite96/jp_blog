<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_151372">This is a new weekly segment I am doing called Workflow Wednesday. Every Wednesday I will be sharing workflows I have either made myself or found elsewhere that is worth sharing with you. If you haven’t tried out Workflow yet I highly suggest <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/workflow/id915249334?mt=8&amp;at=1000lHAf">downloading it</a> (it’s free).</p>
<h3 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_151378">What The Workflow Is</h3>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_151381">This week is how to get the app icons from an App Store URL. Meaning that you can share a link from the App Store and then run a workflow that will get the image of the app icon, and mask it to look like a home screen version of it. This is great if you are writing a blog post or want to use an app icon of something to share in a document or website.</p>

<h3 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_151387">How it Works</h3>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_151390">The masking part of this is a new addition to the latest Workflow update and it’s probably my favorite thing about Workflow image manipulation as of right now. It makes things very easy to conform image to match the style of app icons. You can also use the mask for other things like a rounded rectangle, an ellipse, or even your own custom image. I have not tested the custom image just yet but <a href="https://www.macstories.net/ios/workflow-1-7-8-adds-mask-image-action-things-automation-support-pdf-text-extraction-and-more/">according to MacStories</a> it can be done with some trial and error.</p>
<blockquote id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_151396"><p>
  in my early tests with this feature, I had fun using random images from my photo library as masks and understanding how Workflow treated their brightness as a custom alpha mask. According to the app's documentation, darker colors in the alpha mask become transparent and lighter colors remain opaque; the mask is also resized to match the dimensions of the source image if necessary.

<h3 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_151400">How to Use It</h3>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_151403">Once you <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/c3548416edbe441989b0e71bf418b4f2">download the workflow</a> it is simple to run it and save the image for later use.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_151409">Simply open the App Store and find the app you want to save the icon for and tap “Share App.”</p>
<pre><code>  &lt;img src="https://tablethabit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/6FFBD398-784D-4900-B314-0BE1476436FD.png" alt=""/&gt;
</code></pre>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_151415">From there tap the “Run Workflow” option in the share sheet. If you don’t see it you may need to check and see if you have it enabled. To do that scroll all the way to the right on the bottom section and tap “More” and make sure the Run Workflow option it switched on.</p>

</code></pre>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_151421">Finally, select the App Icon Workflow you just installed. For you it may be more towards the bottom depending how many workflows you have that are action extensions.</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_151427">This workflow came in handy for me when I was working on getting the images for <a href="https://www.tablethabit.com/ebook">a new ebook</a> I am working on. I took the apps I wanted to cover in this ebook and ran this workflow to make the app icons and then save them in a folder on my iCloud for later use in Pages.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_151433">All in all this may be a simple workflow but it has been getting a lot of mileage from me and I think if you ever want to grab an app icon this will do the job for you.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_151436">You can <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/c3548416edbe441989b0e71bf418b4f2">download the workflow here</a> if you would like it.</p>
<p>&lt;</p>
