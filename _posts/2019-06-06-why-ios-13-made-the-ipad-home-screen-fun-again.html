<p>The newly announced <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipados/ipados-preview/">iPadOS</a> is Apple making the iPad operating system different to that of the iPhone. Now, gone are the days of mobile browsing on an iPad, and gone are the days where changes for iPhone are less-then-optimized for the iPad<sup id="fnref-957-1"><a class="jetpack-footnote" href="#fn-957-1">1</a></sup>. One of the things iPadOS offers in iOS 13 is the Today View widgets being pinned to the home screen of the iPad.</p>
<p><img style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" title="Apple_iPadOS_Today-View_060319.jpg" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/03219-apple_ipados_today-view_060319.jpg" alt="Apple iPadOS Today View 060319" width="599" height="484" border="0" /></p>
<p>Now, if you so choose, you can slide the widgets over from the left onto the home screen and always have them on the home screen of your iPad. This bodes well for anyone who wants to utilize the widget screen more, as well as those who want more whimsy on their iPad; because who doesn't want a little variety on their home screen?</p>
<p>For me, I think this is going to make apps with crappy widgets, or no widgets at all, push to make them more usable and feature rich. I haven't been one to use widgets because it's always been an "out of sight out of mind" thing for me. Now that it's on the home screen I think that this is going to make me rethink my entire iPad workflow. Apps like <a href="http://timeryapp.com">Timery</a>, <a href="https://eventail.app">Eventail</a>, and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209055">Shortcuts</a> offer <em>great</em> widgets that I can tap to run actions or use to check on something without the need of opening an entire app. For example I can run a saved timer in Timery from the home screen instead of having to open the app and tap on it or running a specified shortcut. It all lives in the widget now and makes for things to be much more fluid and smooth.</p>
<p>I think that the home screen for the iPad just got a whole lot more useful as well, because when the addition of the Dock on the iPad I rarely kept apps on the home screen. The Dock added a lot of utility to the iPad but with that came the question of whether to keep everything on you iPad in a folder or two within the Dock or still use the home screen even though it isn't as optimized for multitasking as the Dock was.</p>
<p>As of right now I am no on the beta but I plan to as soon as there is a build that is reliable. Once that happens, I think my new setup will be to have more things on the home screen <em>because</em> I will be going to it more and more thanks to this new addition.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to seeing what both developers and other users make of this once iOS 13 becomes available as a public beta, but until then I will be keeping an eye out for any apps that make significant improvements to their widgets and share them here on Rocket Panda.</p>
