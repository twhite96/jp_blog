				<a href="http://macsparky.com">David Sparks</a> has been experimenting with Hyper-Scheduling for quite some time now, it started on his podcast <a href="https://www.relay.fm/shows/freeagents/"><em>Free Agents</em></a> and trickled into the new podcast he has with <a href="http://rosemaryorchard.com">Rose Orchard</a> called <a href="https://www.relay.fm/automators/"><em>Automators</em></a>. It’s no surprise he has now made it into a Workflow.</p>
<p>If you aren’t sure what Hyper-Scheduling is, it’s blocking out time in a calendar as a means to plan out your day. Instead of making a task list and working around that, you instead block out time for the important projects on that list and stick to a plan. The difference is that the <strong>when</strong> is in tandem with the <strong>what</strong>.</p>
<h2>How it Works</h2>
<p>David created a very nice video tutorial on how the Workflow is made, explaining  all the different things you can put in each event, and so on.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.macsparky.com/blog/2018/2/the-hyper-scheduling-experiment">download the Workflow here</a> if you don’t want to make one yourself.</p>
<p>I am going to start giving Hyper-Scheduling a shot as I think it may help me keep on task more often and make things a little more structured. This Workflow is a good jumping off point for me, and I think it may be for you too if you have been wanting to try out Hyper-Scheduling yourself.</p>
<p>If you have any tweaks or changes you would make in this Workflow <a href="http://twitter.com/iamjeffperry">let me know on Twitter</a>.		</p>
