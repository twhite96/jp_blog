<p>Just after Christmas I always feel overwhelmed. Overwhelmed with packing my gifts away, overwhelmed with decompressing after being &ldquo;on&rdquo; throughout the holiday season, and overwhelmed with the amount of things I have to do to get the new year &ldquo;started right.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1518970896312_110464">I always have the need to clean up my life towards the end of the year, both physically and mentally, so that I go into the new year with the right mindset and the best possible workstation I can make for myself.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1518970896312_110467">The problem is I very quickly find that I am not able to keep track of everything I need to do and my desk seems more like a storage unit in an episode of <em>Hoarders</em>.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1518970896312_110473">This month I want to change that, I want to stick to keeping my tasks and things I want to do in order. I want to have a space dedicated to my writing at my home. If you&rsquo;re asking yourself why I suddenly have a fire lit under me about doing this, the answer is simple.</p>
<h2 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1518970896312_110476">Why I am Doing this</h2>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1518970896312_110479">The big reason I am doing this is because of a documentary called <a href="https://minimalismfilm.com/"><em>Minimalist: A Documentary About the Important Things</em></a> that opened my eyes about <a href="https://www.theminimalists.com/minimalism/">minimalism</a> and about compulsory shopping. The main message was that we simply don&rsquo;t need as much stuff as we think we do.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1518970896312_110489">I don&rsquo;t think I will be as minimal as the two main subjects in the documentary but I do think a change is needed in my life because I simply feel overrun when I have too many things on my desk, in my closet, and in my living space.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1518970896312_110492">So the documentary got me interested with minimalism but the message is what had me take action. And the action I&rsquo;ve taken so far has been very uplifting.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1518970896312_110495">I decided the first thing I wanted to do with my life to minimize the things I needed was with my desk. Before I started this I had a desk drawer filled to the brim with things I habitually threw in there when I thought I would need it someday but not today. The three drawers I had contained things like 4 pairs of nail clippers, keyboards I no longer used, and a small office worth of disposable pens to name a few. Shocker: I didn&rsquo;t need any of them now.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1518970896312_110498">So I decided to start emptying out the drawers and see with it was that I actually needed. The answer was <em>none of it</em>. I had a dedicated fountain pen on my Bullet Journal for journaling, I had a Smart Keyboard on my iPad for writing, and everything else I need was in my to-go bag I take with me everywhere. The drawers held items that did not need to stay with me. So I packed it away in storage and everything I <em>need</em> in my life day-to-day is either on my desk or in my bag at arms reach.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1518970896312_110507">The feeling of serenity and the weight I felt lifting off my shoulders as I closed my storage closet was something I did not expect, and I wanted to continue this. Minimalism was working, and I began thinking about how I use my iPhone and iPad and the apps that cluttered them.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1518970896312_110510">Which leads me to the challenge I am going to take in the month of January.</p>
<h2 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1518970896312_110513">What I am doing</h2>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1518970896312_110516">The challenge for this is simple: start with the stock apps you get when getting a new device and only download the apps you <em>need</em> and leave the rest behind. Now, there are some rules to this challenge I am setting myself as well to keep me on track and preventing myself from clutter on my devices</p>
<ol id="yui_3_17_2_1_1518970896312_110522">
<li>Delete any app you don&rsquo;t use after 48 hours of downloading.</li>
</ol>
<ul id="yui_3_17_2_1_1518970896312_110526">
<li>If I need that app again for whatever reason I can always re-download it, but the point of this challenge is to have only the essentials. Apps I don&rsquo;t use after 2 days its initial use are no longer considered essential for me.</li>
</ul>
<ol id="yui_3_17_2_1_1518970896312_110530">
<li>Have everything on one screen</li>
</ol>
<ul id="yui_3_17_2_1_1518970896312_110534">
<li>the main reason for this is because if I limit myself to one screen it leaves me having to really think about what is worth the space on my screen.</li>
<li>There are a lot of stock apps I simply don&rsquo;t need and they can be pushed back in a folder to stay out of sight and refrain from taking up my precious screen real estate.</li>
</ul>
<ol id="yui_3_17_2_1_1518970896312_110540">
<li>Document in a journal your feelings and changes every day for the next 3 weeks</li>
</ol>
<ul id="yui_3_17_2_1_1518970896312_110544">
<li>Doing this challenge and not keeping track of the changes and my feelings on this is hardly a challenge at all. For every experiment there has to be documented analysis for this and daily journaling is something I think will provide that.</li>
</ul>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1518970896312_110548">Now that these rules are set, all that is left is actually doing this.</p>
<h2 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1518970896312_110551">What&rsquo;s Next</h2>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1518970896312_110554">With the challenge and the time frame set all that is left is action and analysis.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1518970896312_110557">So for the next week I will be writing in my journal once a day about the feelings I have and the changes that happens with it. Once the week is over I will report back on January 8th to check in. I will do this every week and come back at the end of the month with my thoughts, information on how things went, and anything I would do differently if I did this again.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1518970896312_110560">So for now I am left with an empty desk, an iPhone and iPad reset, and nothing but 21 days of essential apps to use.</p>
