<blockquote><p>Too often, people view products as dollar signs first, and products second. Yes, price is a factor when making any purchase, but I don’t think that Microsoft is going to move the needle much by releasing this product. Yes, with it’s similar size, build, and price tag, it absolutely is a direct competitor to the iPad, but I don’t see how this solves problems for real people. At least, not in a way that a multitude of other Windows machines are already doing. I see 2 major problems with the Surface Go.</p>

<p>The Microsoft Surface Go never seemed to be an “iPad Killer” to me. It always seemed to be a way for Microsoft to <em>try</em> to compete with Apple and the iPad. Honestly I can’t see many people comparing these two devices evenly, and Matt goes into detail on both software and hardware on this in his post.</p>
<p>My biggest takeaway with Microsoft doing this at all is that they continue to play around with their devices to try and make things for all kind of consumers. Which is a good thing in the long run, but the Microsoft Surface Go seems to be a swing and a miss if I ever saw one.		</p>
