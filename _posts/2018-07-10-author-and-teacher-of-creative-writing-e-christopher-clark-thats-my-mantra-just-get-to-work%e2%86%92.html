<blockquote><p>
<em>How do you manage to find the time for writing, in addition to your bread-and-butter job?</em></p>
<p>It’s hard. I used to carve out a couple of hours per morning or evening. But I have kids now, too. And I made a promise to myself to put family first, so sometimes the writing time disappears in order to help my kids with their homework or their own creative endeavors. But when I do decide to put my butt in the seat to write, I am fiercely protective of that time. I think Stephen King said in On Writing that he doesn’t write every day of every week of his life, but that when he is writing he writes every day. That’s what I strive towards.</p>
<p><em>What, do you think, is most important for an author: Jeff Perry talent, craft, or diligence?</em></p>
<p>Diligence. We’re all born with some degree of talent, which we nurture by reading a lot and writing a lot. Craft is something you pick up along the way, again by reading and writing a lot. But there’s no getting around the fact that diligence is the most important factor. You have to want it. You have to want it bad, and work at it (in at least some small way) all of the time.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Ulysses isn&#8217;t only a great app, but it is also a really well done blog for creatives to draw inspiration from. The questions they ask aren&#8217;t just cookie-cutter questions and I am impressed with the answers they get from their interviewees.</p>
<p>I also love how Christopher Clark explains the importance of diligence. It really validates my reasoning for writing every day on Tablet Habit, and also lights a fire under me.		</p>
