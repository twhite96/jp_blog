<p>Greg had me on the podcast recently and I came to some realizations during our conversation about <a href="https://jeffperry.blog/2019/04/crossing-the-finish-line/">my inability to continue with projects</a>. I love this podcast and it was a pleasure to be a guest on it.</p>
<p>Also, Greg managed to edit this is record time. We recorded the episode Sunday and he posted it the following Tuesday. Insane!</p>
