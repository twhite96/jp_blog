				<a href="http://www.wooji-juice.com/blog/hexterity-welcome-back.html">Hexterity: Welcome Back! — Wooji Juice</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ten years ago today, the App Store opened for the first time.</p>
<p>Ten years ago today, Wooji Juice began selling its first iOS app in the App Store.</p>
<p>In the following months, there would be something of a “gold rush” as people piled in to try and capitalise on the success of the iPhone, but Wooji Juice was there on day one.</p>
<p>I’d quit my job a month or two earlier. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3gw1XddJuc">When the iPhone was announced</a>, I believed that if Apple did what they said they were going to, then it would be a breakthrough product that upended the technology world. But the software was the missing piece of the puzzle.</p>
<p>So when the iPhone OS (as it was known then) SDK became available, I handed in my notice. A couple of weeks later I left, downloaded the SDK, and turned Wooji Juice (my personal blog of occasional ramblings about tech and stuff) into Wooji Juice (my iOS app business). And ten years and a dozen or so apps later, here we are.</p></blockquote>
<p>Canis is one of those developers that you just want to get to know on a personal level. I didn&#8217;t get to know him until I started to look into <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ferrite-recording-studio/id1018780185?mt=8&amp;at=1000lHAf">Ferrite</a> but in the podcasts he has been on and interviews he has done, it is clear that he not only cares immensely about his users but also wants to make sure that his apps are polished and perfect. I am glad he put everything into the apps he made, because I wouldn&#8217;t be able to podcast on an iPad without his hard work.		</p>
