				I found this Workflow late last night and it's golden. With this you can now send text into Drafts 5 with Workflow. Rosemary Orchard really nails it with this Workflow and you all should read more of her!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rosemaryorchard.com/blog/workflow-drafts-5">Rose Orchard at Rosemary Orchard</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Workflow has built in support for Drafts 4 - but no actions for Drafts 5. This workflow is intended to replace some of that functionality. You can share text to it, get text from the clipboard, type text in, or modify the text on the keyboard to start.

<p>If you want to have more info on how to use this find her article in the link above for a more step-by-step walkthrough.</p>
<p>You can get the workflow here: <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/a610c7715c2c466e955fe00efbb796b3">Drafts 5</a>		</p>
