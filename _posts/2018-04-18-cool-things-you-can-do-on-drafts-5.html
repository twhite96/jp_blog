<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_95848">This week's Workflow Wednesday is kind of an audible, but <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-5-capture-act/id1236254471?mt=8&amp;at=1000lHAf">Drafts 5</a> was released today and I wanted to share some of the cool things you can do with it.<br />
There are a slew of great reviews of this out there (like <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/drafts-5-the-macstories-review/">MacStories</a> by <a href="https://nahumck.me/">nahumck</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t932yYzE1gQ">Christopher Lawley's video</a>). So I am going to let those fantastic people share their reviews and thoughts on what the app has to offer while I show you some really cool things Drafts in their <a href="http://actions.getdrafts.com/">Drafts 5 directory</a>.</p>
<h2 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_95866">Send List to Things</h2>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_95869">I recently hopped on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/things-3-for-ipad/id904244226?mt=8&amp;at=1000lHAf">Things 3</a> bandwagon, and so far I am loving it. However, I am not a huge fan of not having native multiple task input support. Meaning I want to be able to add a ton of tasks without having to input them one by one. This is where Drafts comes in.</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_95878">With this handy action you can make a list and each new line is seen as a new task. So if I have a ton of things on my mind I want out and captured in Things 3 I can do so with just a single swipe and tap!</p>
<h2 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_95881">Run Workflow</h2>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_95884">I have spent a ton of time in <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/workflow/id915249334?mt=8&amp;at=1000lHAf">Workflow</a>, and I love the things I have built. Instead of trying to reinvent the wheel, Drafts has a handy action built in that you can simply have it run a previously built workflow. All you need to do is edit the action and put in the name of the Workflow. Make sure it is exactly the same, otherwise it will error out, this is one of those times where it is case-sensitive.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_95890">One workflow I have is to post Markdown text I’ve written as a Wordpress article. So with a quick tap Drafts takes the work I have written and takes it to Workflow to send to my blog. Super handy for the quick linked-posts I do from time to time.</p>
<h2 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_95893">Micro.blog</h2>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_95896">I have spent more and more time on the up-and-coming <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a> social media service <a href="http://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a>. It has become a safe-haven for me to turn to when I wanted to leave Facebook and spend less time on Twitter. I find the community great and it has functions to send out <a href="http://jeffperry.micro.blog/">my posts in Micro.blog</a> to Twitter so I can kill two birds with one stone.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_95908">Drafts makes it even easier for me. Now, I don't even need to open the app to send out a quick post. I can just type it out and then send it through the action and the rest is taken care of. This is why I love Drafts, I can quickly send out a post, a tweet, or a message to someone, and then keep right on trucking with my work.</p>
<h2 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_95911">Event in Fantastical</h2>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_95914">I love Fantastical and their amazing natural language input they have, it makes adding calendar events fun again. But what is even easier is typing it out in Drafts and sending it to <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fantastical-2-for-ipad/id830708155?mt=8&amp;at=1000lHAf">Fantastical 2</a> to sort out for me.</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2C2ECBC5-C9BE-49DC-95EC-14541FFEDE4C.png" alt="" /></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_95923">All I do is write something like "Coffee with Jim next Thursday at 9am /p" and it sends it to Fantastical with the name "Coffee with Jim" scheduled for next Thursday at 9am in my Personal calendar. Boom, event added. The “/p” portion is part of Fantastical syntax that takes the “/“ icon and a letter or two written out</p>
<h2 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_95926">Save to File as</h2>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_95929">Drafts 5 has cloud syncing and auto-saving feature with this app, but sometimes I want to keep a backup of the long posts I write in it, and plain text is my preferred method.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_95932">So, I have an action that takes the text I wrote in Drafts, it then prompts me to enter the file name I want. It defaults to a .txt but you can change the filetype to .md or .rtf if you so choose. For me .txt is fine so I leave it. From there it opens up the Files document picker and allows you to save it to any folder in iCloud, or other 3rd party cloud services you have turned on in the Files App, and save it. Now you have a backup of all your hard work!</p>
<h2 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_95935">Conclusion</h2>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_95938">Drafts 5 is an app I have tried out for testing purposes, but it has easily become one of my absolute favorite apps on iOS. It allows me to get things out of my head and send them out when I want to. I no longer spend my mental RAM trying to figure out what I want to do first, the n what to say.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_95941">Drafts makes the process a complete 180 from what it was. Instead of trying to find the app to use, <em>then</em> working on what I want to say, I now can work on getting my ideas and writing out of my head <em>first</em> then send it wherever it needs to. I just tap the app in my dock and dump what’s on my mind out of my head and it’s saved for later organization.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_95950">For me, this is how things should be when you have ideas and creativity: a frictionless workspace.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_95953">If you want to get Drafts 5, you can <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-5-capture-act/id1236254471?mt=8&amp;at=1000lHAf">download it on the App Store</a>. It is free, but if you want all the features you'll have to go Pro. It is either $19.99 a year or 1.99 a month. For me, I am paying the $1.99 a month because it allows me to pay Greg more money then $19.99 a year. That is how much I love this app.</p>
