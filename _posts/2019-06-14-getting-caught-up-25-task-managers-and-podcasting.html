<p>In <a href="https://gettingcaughtup.net/episodes/25">episode 25 of Getting Caught Up</a> Mike and I talk a lot about task managers and getting things right when it comes to keeping tasks together. Jeff explains his checkered past with nearly every task manager out there, and he lets fate decide what app he uses next. Also, Spotify is talked about briefly at the end of the episode.</p>
