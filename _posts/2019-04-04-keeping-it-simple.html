<p>This week for me has been all too familiar, meaning I moved my site from micro.blog to Wordpress <em>again</em>.</p>
<p>The reasoning for this doesn’t really even matter anymore because I have done nothing for the past several months but screw around with where my site is hosted instead of doing what matters <strong>writing</strong>. After hours of editing my new WordPress website, talking with support, and waiting for DNS changes to propagate I have finally managed to have Rocket Panda back up and running.</p>
<p>I have mentioned it in the past, but I think one of the reasons I do this is because I treat my blog like a Lego collection instead of a platform. I try to make sure every block is perfectly put together instead of making sure that what I’m building is even worthwhile.</p>
<p>I also feel like it is a form of procrastination. I would ask myself questions like, “How can I make time for writing on my site? I have so much I need to do to make Rocket Panda look better.”</p>
<p><strong>Today that changes.</strong></p>
<p>As of today I have made a promise to myself to stick it out on WordPress and use a seriously simple theme called <a href="http://mtomas.com/1/">Tiny Framework</a>. It is a simple yet effective theme that meets my simple blogging needs. It also allows for fast loading and processing. You add that to <a href="https://www.easywp.com/">EasyWP</a>, my hosting platform, and you have yourself a cheap and fast website that doesn’t need anything else.</p>
<p>I have made the commitment to myself, and now with you all publicly, to not make any more changes to the hosting platform, theme, or aesthetics for the rest of 2019. The only exemption from this is if something is catastrophic to the website and requires me to make changes to it in order for it to be fully functional. Outside of that what you see is what you get. What you see may not be deserving of any design awards, but you can at least read what I have to say easily and not have any issues loading the site.</p>
<p>My reasoning for this commitment, and really a lot of things I get hung up about, is to stop worrying about the granular details and just keep things simple. I also needed to take stock in what was important for me on Rocket Panda, and for me it is the content. I would rather have a website that looks like it was built with a default template on Blogger in 2004 with tons of posts than have the most beautiful website with no content to show for it. So I am choosing to keep this less-then-beautiful website as-is and focus on what I want to say on it instead.</p>
<p>With this off my chest and the burden of making my website “look perfect” gone I can finally get back to what I made Rocket Panda for in the first place: to share my thoughts, opinions, and anecdotes about the things I care about.</p>
