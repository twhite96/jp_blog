<p>This is just a quick little tip for iPad users out there. If you are like me and using the Smart Keyboard or any keyboard that doesn't have an Escape key you can press <code>command</code> + <code>.</code> and that will <em>most likely</em> work as a way to escape from any text input you are in. I have found it to work in Google Sheets, Things 3, Safari, and several other apps. Your mileage may vary but for me it seems to work more times than not.</p>
<p>Give it a shot and let me know where else you find it to work. You can <a href="mailto:jeff@rocketpanda.net">email me</a> or get <a href="https://twitter.com/iamjeffperry">a hold of me on Twitter</a>.</p>
