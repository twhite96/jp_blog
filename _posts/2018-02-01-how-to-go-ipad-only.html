<p>If you are wanting to leave your laptop behind for the more portable, convenient, and just pleasant experience that is iOS there is one way to make this transition stick, and it isn&rsquo;t what you think. The best way is to <strong>remove all other options</strong> and only have an iPad available. It may sound simple, but when you limit yourself innovation takes over. This by no means is easy, but it is the best in my opinion. There is somewhat of a learning curve needed to acclimate yourself.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_368592">To help you decide if this is right for you, I have come up with 3 things you need to consider when making the conscious choice to leave Mac or PC behind and go iOS only.</p>
<ol id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_368595">
<li>Are You Willing to Change Workflows?</li>
</ol>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_368599">Making this change in your workflows will create some hurdles you may not have had to get over before. But know this, it <em>is</em> possible to use iOS exclusively. To do this you need to know what to do to combat issues that may come up. For that I have a few posts that will help when getting started.</p>
<ul id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_368605">

<li>Why iPad vs Mac</li>
<li>Learn How to Use Workflow</li>
</ul>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_368616">I have been using my iPad as my main computer for almost a year and it has become more fluid and second-nature to do nearly everything I could on my Mac. Some things are a little less intuitive but other things I used to do on my Mac seem like they were actually meant for iOS in the first place.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_368619">All in all, for me, iOS has made my workflows more intentional and effective than they were on the Mac.</p>
<ol id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_368622">
<li>How Important is Automation to You?</li>
</ol>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_368626">Between Applescripts, applications like <a href="https://www.noodlesoft.com/">Hazel</a>, and other automation options you may be using, iOS is a much more sandboxed experience. This may sound like a bad thing to you, it was for me when I started. But here&rsquo;s how I think of it now: iOS makes you focus more on what is <em>important</em>.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_368635">Now, automation is available for iOS. There is an app called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/workflow/id915249334?mt=8&amp;at=1000lHAf">Workflow</a> that Apple acquired last year. It provides the bridges to our apps that we needed, but doesn&rsquo;t run in the background like Hazel or other software can.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_368641">Automation for iOS isn&rsquo;t the same as Mac, not by a long shot, but it doesn&rsquo;t need to be. I have found the limitations brought to me with iOS automation has actually improved my abilities to work on the things that matter and let the rest fall to the wayside without much hesitation. This is one of <em>the biggest</em> reasons I moved to iOS more and more over the years and why I keep coming back in times of doubt.</p>
<ol id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_368647">
<li>Do You Enjoy Trying New Things?</li>
</ol>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_368651">When I made the switch to iOS, I made the decision to start right from the bottom and leave all my previous notions of computing at the virtual doorstep. I wanted a clear head and an open-mind when I took this plunge.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_368654">I am not going to lie, there were times when I went back to my Mac, but even when I caved a little I kept remembering all the things that were fun and delightful on my iPad over my Mac and I kept coming back because of it.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_368657">I have learned a ton about iOS and about myself through the last year when I started this journey. I feel like I know how I prefer my work done more than I did before, and I spend less time problem solving and more time actually doing. If I hadn&rsquo;t made that switch to my iPad Air 2 when I did I don&rsquo;t think I would be as confident in my work as I am now and definitely not as productive.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_368660">The iPad offered me what no other computer did: purpose.</p>
<h2 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_368663">So You Want to Use Your iPad More, What Now?</h2>
