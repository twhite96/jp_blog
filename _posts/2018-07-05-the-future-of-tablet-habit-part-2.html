				So by now you should have heard about the changes I have made to the change to use a MacBook Pro as my main device. I could go into the reasons why, but I want to talk more about what this means for Tablet Habit. In a recent episode of <a href="http://aslabofglass.com/11">A Slab of Glass</a> I talked about the possibility of moving the website away from Tablet Habit and into something a little less specific.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, <a href="http://twitter.com/mikerapin">Mike Rapin</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/chris_lawley">Christopher Lawley</a> talked me off this branding ledge.If you haven't listened to this episode I really recommend you do! We dive deep into my issue, but also talk more broadly about things like imposter syndrome and the importance of consistency; which brings me to my next announcement.<br />
<br />
I plan to write on Tablet Habit daily every Monday through Friday starting this upcoming Monday July 9th. This has been something I have been wanting to do for a while and when I saw that I have been writing on here for over 6 months (it will be a year in October) I knew I wanted to step up my writing and make more consistent content. This venture wasn't something I thought I would love so much, I mainly did it to take a break from podcasting, but this has been a lot of fun and very exciting to do for the better part of a year. Blogging is something that I think is in my DNA.<br />
<br />
I love to share content and write about the things I am passionate about, but seeing people read my work and go out of their way to reach out to me on Twitter has been humbling and exhilarating.<br />
<br />
The future of Tablet Habit may not be <em>just</em> about iPads, but it really never was. It was a place for me to share my thoughts on Apple, iOS, productivity, and now macOS as well. These are things I am passionate about and something that I see myself doing regularly for a long time. So while Tablet Habit isn't an iPad only blog like I intended when I started, I think this change in the narrative is something that is not only going to bring more value to you, but also something that is more fulfilling for me.<br />
<br />
I thank you for reading and I hope this change is something that you are as excited about as me. If you have anything you want to talk to me about feel free to leave a comment below, <a href="http://twitter.com/iamjeffperry">find me on Twitter</a>, or <a href="mailto:contact@tablethabit.com">shoot me an email</a>. Until then, I will see you all Monday!		</p>
