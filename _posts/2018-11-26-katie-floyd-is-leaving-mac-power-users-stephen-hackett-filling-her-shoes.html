				<a href="https://talk.macpowerusers.com/t/all-good-things/9465">Katie Floyd from Mac Power Users Forum</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>After nine years and more than 450 episodes, the time has come for me to say goodbye to Mac Power Users.<br />
<br />
Never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined the success of this podcast or the opportunities it would create. I would not be where I am today, personally or professionally, without this show. I owe a debt of gratitude to our sponsors, listeners, and most of all, to my co-host David Sparks. You have lived with me through life, loss, new homes, careers, and nearly every other significant milestone. Throughout it all, MPU has been there.<br />
<br />
To everything, there is a season. I&rsquo;m turning to a different season in my life. December 31st will mark my last episode of Mac Power Users. I have not come to this decision hastily, it&rsquo;s something David and I have been talking about for several months and the end of the year seems a natural time to wrap things up.<br />
<br />
The show will go on. We are pleased to announce Stephen Hackett will be the new co-host of Mac Power Users with David starting in January. I can think of no one better. Stephen is passionate about the Mac platform, and I am confident leaving knowing that the show is in good hands with David and Stephen at the helm.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Katie is leaving big shoes to fill, and it&rsquo;s why I was deeply humbled when David asked me to step in as his new cohost. I am beyond thrilled to announce that I will be taking up the mantle on Mac Power Users starting in January.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>David and I have been hard at work planning our first episodes. If you are a MPU listener, let me put your mind at ease: we aren&rsquo;t radically changing what has made the show so good for so long. We will still be diving deep into topics, comparing apps, interviewing guests and getting our nerd on about all sorts of topics.<br />
<br />
If you don&rsquo;t subscribe to Mac Power Users, I&rsquo;d encourage you to check it out. It&rsquo;s pretty different from my other shows, and a challenge I look forward to meeting each and every week.</p></blockquote>

<a href="https://www.relay.fm/mpu">Mac Power Users</a> was one of the first tech podcasts I ever listened to and I have had a long-standing relationship with this podcast.<br />
<br />
I was just listening to <a href="https://www.relay.fm/mpu/353">an older episode about setting up a new Mac</a> (more on that later) and I just loved the back-and-forth both David and Katie had about David first getting an iPad Pro, then later &ldquo;stealing the thunder&rdquo; from Katie after buying a new MacBook Pro like she had. Something about the two of them doing that show was infectious and one of the few podcasts I would have go straight to the top of my queue when it came out.<br />
<br />
I think Stephen will be a good match as a co-host with David. To be the yin to his yang as Katie said. It is sad (but also exciting for Katie&rsquo;s &ldquo;offline life&rdquo;) to see Katie go, but I couldn&rsquo;t have thought of a better person for her to pass the preverbal baton to then Stephen Hackett.<br />
<br />
I look forward to what the next few episode of MPU will hold with Katie, and I am equally excited to see what comes in the new year with David and Stephen having a podcast together.		</p>
