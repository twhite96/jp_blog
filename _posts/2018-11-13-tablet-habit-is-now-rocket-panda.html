				As of today Tablet Habit is now Rocket Panda. Before I go into the full reasoning  why I wanted to share with you what has been going on with me for the last few weeks.</p>
<p>To make a long story short, I have been having a bit of an issue defining my blog. As I have said before, Tablet Habit was a blog for me to explain how I use the iPad as my main device and it was a way for me to express my love for iOS and the iPad. That all changed once I started using my 2017 MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>I started to slowly move more and more things to my Mac and less work on my iPad. Which brought on something of an identity crisis. I gained readers <em>because</em> I was an &ldquo;iPad guy&rdquo; and drifting away from that seems like I was cheating my readers out of what they wanted.</p>
<p>My first idea was to move things from Tablet Habit over to Mac Habit.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_2076" align="alignnone" width="4000"]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2076" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/a960ca7d76.jpg" alt="Logo for Mac Habit I made" width="4000" height="749" /> Logo for Mac Habit I made[/caption]</p>
<p>After a lot of work building a new website from scratch and importing all of my old posts over, Mac Habit was inches away from taking over Tablet Habit. I was excited, nervous, and anxious to show everyone the new website I was going to be using. But then a question popped in my head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes Mac Habit any different than Tablet Habit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The original answer I had was Mac was a more universal term for Apple blogging, and it was something that wasn&rsquo;t tied to anything other than Apple. It wasn&rsquo;t a device-specific name like Tablet Habit. Which sounded fine, but I wanted something even more freeing than Tablet or Mac as my name.</p>
<p>I spent days, even weeks, trying to come up with a new name. Then, during a shower I was taking the name Rocket Panda came to my head and I loved it. It wasn&rsquo;t specific to any kind of topic or idea, and the name stuck with me like glue. If you ask me what it means, I will say it is just a cool name that I enjoy, and that Rocket Panda doesn&rsquo;t <em>need</em> a topic or underlying meaning. It is just something that is catchy and easy to pronounce and type out without any kind of mispronouncing or misspelling. In short, I like the name <em>way more</em> then Tablet Habit or Mac Habit.</p>
<p>Seeing as this is my blog, and has always been a personal endeavor for me, having a name that isn&rsquo;t tied to a specific topic seemed to be the right choice.</p>

<p>This website will still have all the things you loved about Tablet Habit, including all the old posts. The only change you will notice about this site is that it has a new name and a new color scheme to match the flames coming from the Rocket Panda logo. I may deviate from posts about Apple, but this is and forever will be a personal blog where I share my thoughts on things. It will always have my authenticity in it and I like to think people read my stuff because of my personality I put to the page, not the topics that I write about.</p>
