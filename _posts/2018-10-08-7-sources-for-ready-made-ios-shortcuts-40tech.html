				<a href="https://www.tablethabit.com/tagged/workflow-wednesday">Evan Kline at 40Tech</a> did a great job listing some great places for where you can find Siri Shortcuts. I hope to have my <a href="https://www.tablethabit.com/tagged/workflow-wednesday">Workflow Wednesday</a> section on this list once I get things back up and running October 17th.		</p>
