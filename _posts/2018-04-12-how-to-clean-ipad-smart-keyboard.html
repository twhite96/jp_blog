<p>When you are working hard and doing the important things in your day you can find that your iPad Smart Cover might not be in the pristine condition as you would hope. Things like crumbs, dust, cat hair, and other residue on your keyboard can make the typing experience less than ideal. This can be easily fixed with some water and a couple of paper towels. So let’s make a clean iPad Smart Keyboard.</p>
<h3 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_106710">How to Clean Your iPad Smart Keyboard</h3>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_106713">One thing you can do, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204172">according to Apple</a>, is get a damp cloth (or in my case a paper towel) and wipe the Smart Cover to get any residue or dust off the device. Once you do that you will want to get a dry cloth or paper towel and wipe away any water off the devices before they cause any damage.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_106719">Make sure your iPad is not connected to the keyboard. Once you start cleaning the keyboard don’t be shy with getting in between the keys. I found using some elbow grease really made the difference. Don’t use all your might to clean this but don’t be afraid to press down on the keys to scrub off whatever is on the keyboard.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_106722">I also found that having a clean microfiber cloth also helped get those pesky pieces of dust and cat hair off the keyboard. In my case, I had a microfiber cloth I got at my local Dollar Store. If that doesn’t work the first time around I would give it another go with just a little more water.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_106725">One thing I cannot stress enough is that the cloth or paper towel you use only needs to be a bit damp. It doesn’t need to be sopping wet, a dab will do you. While the Smart Keyboard is water resistant, there are small holes on the back of the keyboard to vent air out of the keyboard every time you press a key.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_106728">So if you can’t stand the dust and hair stuck to your keyboard, give it a quick once over and make it shine like new again.</p>
