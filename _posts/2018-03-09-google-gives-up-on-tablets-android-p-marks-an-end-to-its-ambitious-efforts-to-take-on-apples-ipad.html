<blockquote><p>Apple's new iPad suddenly confused everything. For some Mac users, it didn't seem like it could be powerful enough to serve as a computer. Market researchers immediately branded it as a "media consumption device" in a desperate effort to avoid any comparison with PC sales and to disavow any potential for it disrupting sales of Windows PCs, despite their having spent the previous couple years preaching the gospel that cheap, ultralow-end netbook PCs would certainly eat up sales of Macs.<br />
Yet despite waves of media contempt citing certain users' disgruntlement, a deluge of market research white papers explaining that iPad wasn't a real computer, and thunderous umbrage from Adobe expressing outrage over iPad's lack of support for its proprietary Flash content (all of which sounded virtually identical to the themes in this year's launch of HomePod), real world users voted for iPad with their billions of dollars.</p></blockquote>
<p>I haven’t been in the Android game in quite some time but this seems to show just how impenetrable the iPad is in the tablet market. There really isn’t anything that comes close that has had as much support and iterations as the iPad.</p>
<p>Honestly this entire article is just a great historical piece on tablets over the last 9 years. <a href="https://twitter.com/danieleran">Daniel Eran Dilger</a> did a great job on this and you should all read this.		</p>
