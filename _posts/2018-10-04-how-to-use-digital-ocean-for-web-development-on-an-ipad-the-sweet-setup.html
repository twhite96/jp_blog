<blockquote><p>
  While some people have loved the latest editions of MacBook Pro keyboards, others have not. I fall on the side of not liking them at all, which left me with a choice to make with my aging 13&rdquo; MacBook Air. Do I keep using it or look for alternatives?</p>
<p>  After trying Linux and other machines, I turned to my 9.7&rdquo; iPad Pro wondering if I could do all my work from an iPad. I already had my writing, audio editing, and video workflows nailed down with the iPad, but there was a gap for my web development work.</p>
<p>  After some research, I was happy to find that it&rsquo;s quite possible to do all my web development work on an iPad in almost the exact same way I worked on my MacBook Air. Not only did this give me a much less expensive computer with which I could replace my MacBook Air, it also gave me a much more portable and focused work environment.</p>
<p>  Here is how I do web development on my iPad Pro.

<p>Before I thought it wasn&#8217;t possible to do this kind of stuff on an iPad, but I&#8217;m glad I was wrong.</p>
<p>Honestly, this is impressive. Bravo Curtis.		</p>
