<p>I am really excited about this episode. It is full of feelings on my recent hiatus, how I dealt with it, and what changes I have made for Rocket Panda. Mike and I also get into the weeds about independent blogs/podcasts which is something I love to talk about, but as Mike explains can be sort of dangerous. Finally, I show Mike some of my favorite resources to learn and get acquainted with Siri Shortcuts.</p>
