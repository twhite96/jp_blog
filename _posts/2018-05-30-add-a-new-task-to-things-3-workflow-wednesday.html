<p>
				For this edition of Workflow Wednesday I am keeping things in <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-5-capture-act/id1236254471?mt=8">Drafts 5</a>. I have been going all-in with Drafts 5 and one thing I absolutely love is the ability to make Drafts whatever kind of app you want.</p>
<p>It can be a Task management app, like this workflow shows, or a writing app as I have been using it recently. The versatility and power this app can’t be overstated enough. It is crazy what people have come up with it.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mattbirchler">Matt Birchler</a> of <a href="https://birchtree.me/">Birchtree.me</a> has made a very easy way to add tasks with the specific things you want in it very easy with Drafts.</p>
<p>Matt Birchler’s Drafts 5 List:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The task name must always be on the first line. Additional info needs to be prefixed by a set number of strings followed by a space:</p>
<ul>
<li>“at” or “@“ are for due dates (using Things’ smart time parsing, so “10am tomorrow” works)</li>
<li>“tag” or “tags” are for tags</li>
<li>“deadline” or “dead” are for deadlines</li>
<li>
<p>“list” is for projects/lists</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“note” or “-“ (dash) will create a note</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All lines that don’t match up with a prefix listed above will be assumed to be a note</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>He goes on to present this example:</p>
<pre>
    <code>
        Buy some milk
        at 8am tomorrow
        list grocery
        2%
    </code>
</pre>
<p><code>Creates a task to "Buy some milk" due tomorrow at 8AM on the Grocery list/project and a note to buy "2%" milk</code></p>
