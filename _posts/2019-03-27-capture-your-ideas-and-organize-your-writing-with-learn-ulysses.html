<a href="https://thesweetsetup.com/ulysses/">Learn Ulysses 2.0 is now available!</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Learn Ulysses is our popular video course to help you take your notes, ideas, and writing from scattered to structured.</p>
<p>Over 2,500 folks just like you signed up for the original version of this course. After listening to their feedback, we made a bunch of improvements: We re-did every single video and added a whole bunch more of advanced workflows plus additional writing coaching.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Save time with your <strong>new, improved workflows</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enjoy the benefits of having a spot to <strong>quickly capture</strong> your ideas and enjoy the writing process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relax as you <strong>finally get a structure</strong> for your notes and writing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Today, we want to give you all the heads up so that you will know exactly what you&rsquo;re getting when you sign up for Learn Ulysses tomorrow. Basically, we want to convey just how much value there is in the new materials!</p>
<p>I was one of those people who bought the original course when it came out and it was a no-brainer for me to upgrade to the updated version. Ulysses is an app I have been playing around with for well over a year now but I am not entirely sure that I am using it the best I could. So far I am about halfway through the App Tutorials section and I already have 3 pages full of notes and ideas written out.<a href="https://shawnblanc.net">Shawn Blanc</a> is the real deal when it comes to these courses and the fact that he had <a href="http://mikeschmitz.me">Mike Schmitz</a> come and make the screencasts for it is just icing on the cake. I highly recommend this course to anyone looking to get into Ulysses as a writing tool.</p></p>
