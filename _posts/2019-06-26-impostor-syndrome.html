<blockquote><p>
  There’s no developer bit in anyone’s DNA. I don’t have that bit — nobody does. There’s no such thing, and there’s no collection of genes that make you a real developer, either.</p>
<p>  You don’t have to have a CS degree. (I didn’t even own a computer when I was in college. And I didn’t graduate.)</p>
<p>  If you’re working on an app, you’re a developer. Period. Even if it’s not a stand-alone app; even if it’s some scripts. You’re solving a problem on a computer with logic and code — that makes you a developer. That’s all it takes!</p>
<p>  Impostor syndrome goes away eventually. You just forget about it. The fastest way to get past it is probably to help other people.</p>
<p>  It’s okay to admit that you have it. It’s been many years, but I had it too. :)

<p>If you were to replace this for blogging this is what it would look like:</p>
<blockquote><p>

<p>  You don’t have to have an English degree.</p>
<p>  If you’re working on a blog, you’re a blogger. Period. Even if it’s not on your own domain (though, you should really <em>own</em> your site if you do anything online). You’re sharing your thoughts online for others to read — that makes you a blogger. That’s all it takes!</p>

<p>This is me, and I am sure others reading this also agree.</p>
<p>I have been dealing with a lot of things offline lately--which is why I haven't been posting at all--that's partly due to imposter syndrome. I get married in a few days, to my beautiful fiancé. The person that has helped me with all of my mental health issue the better part of a decade now. Afterwords, I hope to keep the imposter syndrome part of what's holding me back at bay.</p>
<p>Until then, if anyone wants to get in touch with me you can do so here on micro.blog or via email at Jeff[at]rocketpanda[dot]net.</p>
