<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_142884">Apple recently put together <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad/how-to/">a beautiful space</a> for iPad users to learn more about what you can do with the tablet. It includes several videos of both simple and pro features you can use on an iPad.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_142890">All of the videos are great, but what really surprised me was the fact that 3rd party apps like <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/goodnotes-4/id778658393?mt=8&amp;at=1000lHAf">GoodNotes 4</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pixelmator/id924695435?mt=8&amp;at=1000lHAf">Pixelmator</a> are getting some love on these videos. I am happy to see Apple showing off some of the best apps offered for the iPad and I hope this continues going forward.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_142899">Appleâ€™s style in these short videos are also probably some of my favorite they have done in years. I enjoy the simplicity, yet rich personality, they put in these.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_142902">There are some things I wish they put in here like Workflow and more writing tools, but I guess that is where I can come in and help more.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_142905">So if you want to spend 10 minutes and <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad/how-to/">watch all of these</a> to either learn some new stuff or just refresh yourself on some things you can do on an iPad I highly recommend it.</p>
