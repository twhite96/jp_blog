				<a href="https://twitter.com/mattcassinelli">Matthew Cassinelli</a>, a former employee for Workflow, has been crushing it on YouTube lately. His video explaining the changes and updates in Siri Shortcuts 2.1 is well worth the 5 minutes of your time.</p>
<p>It is so good I am linking his video instead of sharing one of the shortcuts I made. You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSYPCbntfSE">subscribe to his channel</a> or watch the video below.</p>
