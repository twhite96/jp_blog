<p>The Apple Pencil is a great tool when you need it, but when you don&rsquo;t it can be more of an inconvenience than anything. This is why there are <em>so many</em> Pencil cases and products to allow you to store the pencil when you don&rsquo;t need it.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_385878">Apple joined this game last year with <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MQ0W2ZM/A/apple-pencil-case-midnight-blue">their own case</a>. But there was one problem: it provided no function for transporting it. To do that you would need to buy Apple&rsquo;s $129.00 <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MPU12ZM/A/leather-sleeve-for-105%E2%80%91inch-ipad-pro-saddle-brown">leather sleeve</a>. I don&rsquo;t know about you, but if I have to buy something that costs more than my Apple Pencil to just keep it near my iPad it isn&rsquo;t for me. With that out as an option, I still needed a sleek, high functioning holster for my Pencil.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_385887">This is where <a href="http://twelvesouth.com/">Twelve South</a>&nbsp;comes in with their new product, the <a href="https://www.twelvesouth.com/product/pencilsnap">PencilSnap</a></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_385895">I recently bought my own PencilSnap to see if this would be the final accessory I would need to carry my Apple Pencil once and for all. I have to say, this little piece of leather has a lot going for it.</p>
<h2 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_385898">Look and Feel</h2>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_385901">This holster is very minimal looking and there is no noticeable branding on the product at first glance. However, If you look on the back of it where there are magnets to stick it on a Smart Cover to Smart Keyboard you can see the word PencilSnap embossed on the leather. It is a very subtle but nice touch that is something I wish other brands would do on their products.<code><br />

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_385907">The leather the PencilSnap is made out of is well crafted to say the least. It has the feel of fresh leather you would get from an Apple branded iPhone case. I haven&rsquo;t had it long enough to see how this leather ages over time but if the photos I see of leather iPhone cases on Reddit indicates anything, it is going to look even better after some time and use. I will say that it takes a few time of putting it in and taking the Apple Pencil out for the leather to loosen up. Honestly this was fine after about a dozen time of me taking it out.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_385910">The backing with the magnets is firm but mailable enough to really allow you to pull your pencil in an out without worrying that you are going to break the case. It also bounces back very nicely, leaving my worries of it being forever bent backwards behind.</p>
<h2 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_385913">Functionality</h2>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_385916">This thing is crazy strong. Both with the magnets keeping it on the iPad and the overall casing for the Pencil. I have vigorously shaken the case with the pencil in it and it just doesn&rsquo;t budge. the PencilSnap does its job well and without any margin of error.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_385919">I also have had the case on my iPad 10.5&rdquo; Smart Keyboard and took a shake to that as well, way more than I would actually jostle my iPad in day-to-day use. Again, not a single budge. I wanted to see just how far I had to take things in order to get these magnets to fail.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_385922">So I removed the Smart Keyboard from my iPad and unfurled it to have one long silicone case and a keyboard and shook it like a mad man. Finally, after a few good shakes the force of the case whipping back and forth made it fly off the case. So if you end up whipping your Smart Cover around like it&rsquo;s a bed sheet, this magnet won&rsquo;t work. But if you aren&rsquo;t insane, and you treat your tablet with even a little respect this thing won&rsquo;t fail on you.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_385925">If I find any issues with this over time I will be sure to update this post and let you know, but honestly I don&rsquo;t foresee me having to do that. I am utterly impressed with just how sleek yet strong Twelve South made this.</p>
<h2 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_385928">Conclusion</h2>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_385931">If you aren&rsquo;t satisfied with how you are using your Apple Pencil for travel or just want something to keep your Apple Pencil with your iPad Pro, this $30 accessory will be the only thing you need. It keeps it close to your iPad and safely attached. I would recommend this over Apple&rsquo;s case, or really any other Apple Pencil case, with zero hesitation.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_385934">Twelve South continues to uphold their reputation as one of the leading Apple accessory manufacturers because they sweat the details, and make sure products like the PencilSnap make your life easier and look great too.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_385937">You can pick up your own PencilSnap at <a href="https://www.twelvesouth.com/product/pencilsnap">Twelve South&rsquo;s website</a> for just $1 more than Apple&rsquo;s and get <strong>ten times</strong> more use out of it.</p>
