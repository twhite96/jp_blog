<p>Matthew Cassinelli's review of <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=6218&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Freeder-4%2Fid1449412357%3Fmt%3D8">Reeder 4</a> dives deep into the chasm of what this new RSS reader app offers.</p>
<p>Spoilers: there's <em>a lot</em> to this app, Reeder has really outdone themselves with his app and I hope they continue to innovate and improve reading RSS on iOS and macOS.</p>
