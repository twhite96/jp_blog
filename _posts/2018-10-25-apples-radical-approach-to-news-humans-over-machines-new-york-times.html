				<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/apple-news-humans-algorithms.html">Jack Nicas writing for New York Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In a quiet corner of the third floor, Apple is building a newsroom of sorts. About a dozen former journalists have filled a few nondescript offices to do what many other tech companies have for years left to software: selecting the news that tens of millions of people will read.</p>
<p>One morning in late August, Apple News&rsquo;s editor in chief, Lauren Kern, huddled with a deputy to discuss the five stories to feature atop the company&rsquo;s three-year-old news app, which comes preinstalled on every iPhone in the United States, Britain and Australia.</p>
<p>National news sites were leading that day with stories that the Justice Department had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/30/us/politics/asian-students-affirmative-action-harvard.html?module=inline">backed an affirmative-action lawsuit</a> against Harvard University &mdash; a good proxy that the story mattered, said Ms. Kern&rsquo;s deputy, a former editor for The New York Times whom Apple requested not be named for privacy reasons. He and Ms. Kern quickly agreed that it was the day&rsquo;s top news, and after reading through a few versions, selected <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2018/08/30/justice-dept-criticizes-harvard-affirmative-action-case/?utm_term=.2cc9d6f476e0">The Washington Post&rsquo;s report</a> because, they said, it provided the most context and explanation on why the news mattered.</p></blockquote>
<p>[...]</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We put so much care and thought into our curation,&rdquo; said Ms. Kern, 43, a former executive editor of New York Magazine. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s seen by a lot of people and we take that responsibility really seriously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apple has waded into the messy world of news with a service that is read regularly by roughly 90 million people. But while Google, Facebook and Twitter have come under <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/10/us/politics/mark-zuckerberg-testimony.html?module=inline">intense scrutiny</a> for their disproportionate &mdash; and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/22/technology/facebook-internet-misinformation.html?module=inline">sometimes harmful</a> &mdash; influence over the spread of information, Apple has so far avoided controversy. One big reason is that while its Silicon Valley peers rely on machines and algorithms to pick headlines, Apple uses humans like Ms. Kern.</p>
<p>The former journalist has quietly become one of the most powerful figures in English-language media. The stories she and her deputies select for Apple News regularly receive more than a million visits each.</p></blockquote>
<p>[...]</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple&rsquo;s executives grandly proclaim that they want to help save journalism. &ldquo;There is this deep understanding that a thriving free press is critical for an informed public, and an informed public is critical for a functioning democracy, and that Apple News can play a part in that,&rdquo; Ms. Kern said.</p></blockquote>
<p>For me, I will always choose human over machine when it comes to getting news, and Kern seems to be the perfect person to lead the way for the Apple News team.		</p>
