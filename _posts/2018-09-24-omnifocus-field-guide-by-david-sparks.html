				David Sparks has come out with an extensive Omnifocus Field guide in preparation for the new Omnifocus 3 release for macOS coming today. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2sSar1P2kc">Here&rsquo;s a trailer</a>!</p>
<p>David Sparks has been one of those people I buy pretty much anything he comes out with because his courses and field guides are incomparable, and this Field Guide takes the cake.</p>
<p>I remember watching his first Field Guide for Omnifocus several years back and having my mind blown with what you can do with Omnifocus. With this new and improved Omnifocus, Sparks has spared no attention to detail in showing you what Omnifocus 3 is, how you can use it, and where you can go after you get the fundamentals. He&rsquo;s been working on this thing since March, and it shows with over 5 hours of content bundled in this!</p>
<p>Right now you can <a href="https://learn.macsparky.com/p/omnifocus">get the course for $24</a> but come October that price goes up to $29. So if you have wanted to learn Omnifocus, look no further than this Field Guide to help you kickstart your life into something more organized.		</p>
