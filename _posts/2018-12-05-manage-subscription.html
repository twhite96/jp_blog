				Stephen Hackett of <a href="http://512pixels.net">512 Pixels</a> came up with a <a href="https://512pixels.net/2018/12/quickly-view-app-store-subscriptions/">really sweet solution</a> on how to quickly access your iTunes subscriptions. IT seems like a simple Shortcut once you get into it, but I think some of the best Siri Shortcuts are those that are so simple you wish you'd come up with it.</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/99536c4abf.jpg" alt="Apple Subscription Siri Shortcut" /></p>
<p>What this shortcut does is open a URL to <a href="https://apps.apple.com/account/subscriptions">Apple's Subscription Page</a> and from there iOS users automatically get sent to the iTunes Store app and it shows your subscriptions.</p>
<p>Again, a simple URL allows you to access something that would take several menus and taps to get access to otherwise. Which, to me, is a perfect example of what automation can do for you.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/6bc0f6f5a22b41309e3564378783187a">download the shortcut here</a> and give it a go for yourself.		</p>
