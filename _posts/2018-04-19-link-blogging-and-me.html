				Matt Birchler of <a href="http://birchtree.me">BirchTree.me</a> talked about using block quotes and link posts recently and it got me thinking.</p>
<p><a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/why-i-love-link-blogging/">Why I Love Link Blogging - BirchTree</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The web allows us to create content that is connected with the rest of the web. Everything we do, especially us writers, is kicked off by something someone else said, and we should embrace that. Make your blog a part of a conversation, not an island that feels like you’re just doing this all on your own. None of us are, and we should be proud of that.</p></blockquote>
<p>Honestly, Matt hits the nail on the head with this one. Link blogging is a very standard way to build off of other bloggers and cite them as you expand your own thoughts. It also allows you to make internet friends with other awesome writers, and when you have people to work with and bounce ideas off of, they can be there to help you out.</p>
<p>I have decided to start posting more link posts on Tablet Habit because there are so many awesome bloggers out there, and I want to join their conversations and join this community rather than be “an island” all alone.</p>
<p>Blogging was something I did as a side-project to step away from podcasting. Since then I have started 2 podcasts (<a href="http://gettingcaughtup.net">Getting Caught Up</a> and <a href="http://aslabofglass.com">A Slab of Glass</a>), which is a story in itself, but writing here on Tablet Habit has become my favorite outlet for my creativity and continues to push me to do bigger and better things. For instance, I am publishing a <a href="/ebook">free ebook</a> of my favorite apps to get work done on an iPad at the end of the month. This is something I <em>never</em> would have done if I hadn’t started Tablet Habit.</p>
<p>Matt is a blogger I found through someone else’s blog and/or Twitter, and I am happy I did. I hope to find more awesome writers in the near future as well, which is where <strong>you</strong> can help.</p>
<p>If you know any other bloggers feel free to let me know in the comments below, or over <a href="http://twitter.com/iamjeffperry">on Twitter</a>. You can also <a href="mailto:contact@tablethabit.com">email me</a> if that is your preferred method of contact.</p>
<p>I want to build up my RSS list with more awesome bloggers, so feel free to send <em>as many</em> as you want!</p>
<p>If you want to read the rest of Matt Birchler’s post, you can do so <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/why-i-love-link-blogging/">here</a>. Check out the rest of his stuff too if you like it. His <a href="http://feedpress.me/bst">daily podcast</a> is a delightful way to start your day off right!		</p>
