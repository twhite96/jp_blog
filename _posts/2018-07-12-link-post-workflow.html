				With <a href="https://tablethabit.com/2018/07/the-future-of-tablet-habit-part-2/">Tablet Habit now going daily</a>, I have found myself wanting to post more link posts. Doing this on my Mac is easy with <a href="https://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit 4</a>, but it isn’t as easy with iOS, until I created a workflow that is a hybrid between <a href="https://www.40tech.com/2018/02/10/link-post-workflow-with-ulysses-and-workflow-on-ios/">Evan Kline of <em>40Tech</em></a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/chris_lawley">Christopher Lawley</a> at <a href="http://theuntitledsite.com"><em>The Untitled Site</em></a>.</p>
<h2 id="whatitdoes">What it Does</h2>
<p>For those who aren’t familiar with link posts, it is a very handy way to post articles from elsewhere and add your own input after quoting a selection of the article. You can find <a href="https://tablethabit.com/2018/07/celebrating-the-app-stores-10th-anniversary-with-a-week-of-special-coverage/">an example of one I used recently</a> to get an idea of what I am talking about.</p>
<h2 id="howitworks">How it Works</h2>
<p>So with Workflow, you can use the Share Sheet as a means to run a Workflow and take things like a URL from Safari, your clipboard, and selected text into the workflow to use within it. All three of these examples are used with the Workflow I have created after taking a look at what both Evan and Christopher have done.</p>
<p><a href="https://tablethabit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/LinkPostWorkflow1.png"><img class="alignnone" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" title="LinkPostWorkflow1.PNG" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/LinkPostWorkflow1.png" alt="LinkPostWorkflow1" width="599" height="425" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>First, you need to find the post you want to link in Safari on your iPhone or iPad. From there you select the text you want to use in the post as a quote. With that text selected, open up the share sheet and run the Link Post Workflow.</p>
<p><a href="https://tablethabit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Workflow-Link-Post-Prompt.png"><img class="alignnone" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" title="Workflow-Link-Post-Prompt.png" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Workflow-Link-Post-Prompt.png" alt="Workflow Link Post Prompt" width="597" height="211" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>As the Workflow Opens up there will be two questions that it will ask you. The first question being what the publication is. In this case it is 40tech. After that it will ask for the author’s name, which is Evan Kline.</p>
<p>Once both the publication and the author is determined the workflow will then take the URL of the website you shared and the selected text you highlighted to make it into a Markdown ready post.</p>
<p><a href="https://tablethabit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/LinkPostWorkflow-result.png"><img class="alignnone" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" title="LinkPostWorkflow-result.PNG" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/LinkPostWorkflow-result.png" alt="LinkPostWorkflow result" width="599" height="425" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Once all of the text formatting is done a new Ulysses sheet will be made with the entire link post formatted and linked properly. All that is left now is to write your own response to the link post!</p>
<p>You can download the workflow <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/7e33c173b24449d3b10642d94e3132ca">here</a> and make any changes you need to it. Happy posting!		</p>
