<p>
				Lately I have been using my Mac more and more, and the reason for this is because I find it to have a much easier workflow for my writing than an iPad. This isn't to say that I <em>can't</em> do my work on an iPad, I can and I have, but because of apps like <a href="https://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a> and <a href="http://marked2app.com/">Marked 2</a> I find that the iPad isn't my preferred device for writing anymore.</p>
<p>One of my reasons for this are the apps, and how they have improved my workflow when it comes to my writing.</p>
<h2>MarsEdit</h2>
<p>MarsEdit is probably the go-to application I will tell anyone who is using a Wordpress website to use. It has a solid reputation behind it, and it is all apparent after using it for you site. It is built a lot like a standard Mail application with each post being its own item and the data you want to see right there in rows. It allows you to see all your posts easily and select one that might need to be edited or shared.</p>
<p>Once in the editing mode it supports Markdown, HTML, and plain text editing. It is also a really nice Rich Tech editor similar to the WYSIWYG editor Wordpress used to have before moving over to <a href="https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/">Gutenberg</a>. If you want Markdown syntax highlighting, this sadly isn&rsquo;t the app for you. I spoke with the developer some time ago and I got the feeling that Markdown syntax highlighting isn&rsquo;t something in the works. I could be wrong about this, and I hope I am, but as of right now there is nothing of the sort in MarsEdit.</p>
<p>Once you are done editing your post, things like the post title, slug, categories, and tags are all available to edit and assign prior to going live. The tags you even have saved on your Wordpress website show up when entering them in MarsEdit. You can even use custom fields for things like the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/daring-fireball-linked-list/">Daring Fireball-style Linked List Plugin</a> where you can enter in a custom field with a link and make that URL the hyperlink to your title. You can see a good example of that on <a href="https://jeffperry.blog/2018/12/and-you-are-daryl-baxter/">my post</a> about the new podcast by Greg Morris called <a href="http://andyouare.libsyn.com/"><em>And You Are?</em></a>.</p>
<p>Finally, this application supports image uploading, meaning that you can insert your image in a post on MarsEdit and when you do hit publish that image is then uploaded to Wordpress and attached to the post automatically. This isn&rsquo;t necessarily anything new as apps like Ulysses also do this. That said, it is a nice touch to not make users have to upload their images and then add them through some kind of library or manually copy the image URLs over.</p>
<p>MarsEdit isn't just a very nice editing tool for blog posts, it also provides a wonderful array of admin tools as well. For instance, if you want to get the link to a post on your website, you can just select the post and press control+command+C and the link for the post is copied.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2230 size-large" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/431d4f4090.jpg" alt="" width="676" height="423" /></p>
<p>Not only that, but with a simple plugin on your browser you can make link-posting on your website a cinch. Simply select the text from an article you want to share, click on the MarsEdit browser plugin and, with the power of the Quick Posts setting in MarsEdit, the link from the site where you selected that text is then formatted however you want for link-posting.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2231" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/17dbba04c6.jpg" alt="" width="676" height="611" /></p>
<p>All in all, I think that MarsEdit is a great buy for the price, and if you give it time and really start using it regularly it can be the one and only application you need to post to your blog.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/">buy MarsEdit 4</a> today for your Mac for $49.95. Which seems high, but if you want a powerful one-stop shop for posting your blog, MarsEdit is by far and away worth the money.</p>
<h2>Marked 2</h2>
<p>Marked 2 was an app I didn't think I needed when it came to writing and blogging on the Mac, but once I finally used it I instantly added it to my workflow.</p>
<p>Marked 2 is a simple app on paper, it allows you to open a file with Markdown and see real-time updates to it. Outside of what this does &ldquo;on paper,&rdquo; the flourish and polish of this app makes proofreading and quality control smooth and simple.</p>
<p>Along with adding bold text and italics whenever the syntax shows up, it does things like shows the full URL of a link when you hover over it.</p>
<p>It can show the length of selected text with things like world count and character count and sentences in the selection. It allows you to review and check the version your readers will see, making it the last application necessary before hitting publish.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2236" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/3c47908c3c.jpg" alt="" width="676" height="423" /></p>
<p>It also has an incredible editing system to show you where you can improve on your writing and grammar. It reminds me a lot of the <a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com">Hemingway web-app</a>, showing where you write in passive voice, or when you are using words that have preferred alternatives. So instead of saying something is &ldquo;very large&rdquo; it could show you something like &ldquo;enormous&rdquo; or &ldquo;gigantic&rdquo; making for it to be a much more pleasing thing to read.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2237" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ca733cc9fd.jpg" alt="" width="676" height="431" /></p>
<p>Finally, Marked 2 also allows you to export the finished product as a slew of different file formats. You can save the finished post as things like a Markdown file, a PDF (paginated and continuous), or even HTML if you want to share it to something like MarsEdit and not have to worry about your Wordpress website supporting Markdown formatting.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2201" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/76da2387aa.jpg" alt="" width="676" height="423" /></p>
<p>Marked 2 was the editor I needed when writing as I never feel that my work is worthwhile until I meticulously comb over everything and rewrite draft after draft. Now, with the editing tools and system I can use that as a finish line to when I can stop trying to make it perfect and start making it public.</p>
<p>You can <a href="http://marked2app.com">get Marked 2 for $9.99</a> right now, or <a href="https://go.setapp.com/invite/60158b80-5156-44b5-8024-76271a8a1355"><strong>become a SetApp subscriber</strong></a> and get access to Marked 2, Ulysses, and a slew of other great apps.</p>
<h2>Bringing it All Together</h2>
<p>Now that you know both the apps I cherish on the Mac when it comes to my writing, let's explain the process in my writing and blogging on the Mac.</p>
<p>I first start writing my draft in a text editor. Which is usually <a href="https://ulysses.app">Ulysses</a> on the Mac, which can be an alternative to MarsEdit if you just want a text editor that can post to Wordpress. One thing I prefer with Ulysses is that it <em>does</em> have Markdown syntax highlighting, allowing me to see more clearly the differences I make when I want to bold or italicize something. However, I am not a fan of how Ulysses handles your posts <em>after</em> you send it off to be posted. It just stays right at the folder you had it in. From there I have to figure out what to do with it. Eventually what I decided to do was make a folder called &ldquo;Posted&rdquo; and throw everything I am finished with in there for safe keeping. Once that got cumbersome I decided to make Ulysses my app for writing, and Marked 2 and MarsEdit for editing and publishing respectively.</p>
<p>Anyway, once I am done with my first draft I export the Markdown file of the post to Marked 2 and have both apps side-by-side and make changes to the according to the Keyword Highlight Drawer in Marked 2.</p>
<p>Once done there I send the post to MarsEdit. Once there I add the metadata I need and make sure everything in the post is how I want it. Once I am happy with it I then send it to Rocket Panda for posting.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>The workflow is a little crazy seeing that I am using 3 apps to get one post out on to Rocket Panda, but I feel that if I were to exclude any of these in my blogging process it would make for a lesser product.</p>
<p>One thing that I think is something that I prefer over the Mac is just how easy it can be to edit posts and make changes with ease. When it comes to iOS and the WordPress app, which is the only decent app to handle WordPress content on iOS, it is still clunky and ill-fitting to the styling of iOS.</p>
<p>When I am using MarsEdit and Marked 2 on my Mac it feels like it is the <em>perfect</em> way to make sure that my writing is the best that it can be.		</p>
