<p>
				<a href="https://www.gr36.com">Greg Morris</a> has something special here with <a href="http://andyouare.libsyn.com"><em>And You Are?</em></a>. Hearing episode one with <a href="http://darylbaxter.com">Daryl Baxter</a> also just makes so much sense. The laid back nature of this is something I can get used to easily.</p>
<p><a href="http://andyouare.libsyn.com/01-daryl-baxter">Give this episode a listen</a>, you won&rsquo;t be disappointed.		</p>
