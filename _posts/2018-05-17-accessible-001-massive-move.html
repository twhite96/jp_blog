<p>
				In celebration of <a href="http://globalaccessibilityawarenessday.org/">Global Accessibility Awareness Day</a> I wanted to showcase a new podcast by <a href="https://www.stevensblog.co/">Steven Aquino</a> and <a href="https://www.timothybuck.me/">Timothy Buck</a> called <a href="https://www.accessible.fm/"><em>Accessible</em></a>.</p>
<p>The podcast is by two Indie Bloggers that I admire and follow, and the podcast is all about “the accessibility in tech.”</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Accessible is a fortnightly—episodes are released twice per month—podcast about accessibility in tech. Topics covered on the show are mostly Apple-centric but will span the tech industry at large where appropriate.
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.accessible.fm/episodes/001">Episode 1</a> was recently released, so you can listen to it now and be part of the beginning of another great tech podcast.</p>
<p>Congrats to the both of them and I can’t wait to see how this show blossoms in the future.		</p>
