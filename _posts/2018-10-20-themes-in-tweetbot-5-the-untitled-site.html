<blockquote><p>With some major design changes it feels like a whole new app. There's some hidden easter eggs as well that I&rsquo;ve noticed people may have missed. If you go into setting, tap Support Tweetbot, and give them a tip you can unlock different themes. After that go into display and you can now change your themes. My personal favorite is Pumpkin.</p></blockquote>
<p>This was something I hadn't noticed until Chris told me about it. I'm currently using the Manhattan theme.		</p>
