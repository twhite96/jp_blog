<p>
				After <a href="https://tablethabit.com/2018/07/the-future-of-tablet-habit-part-1/">buying a new MacBook Pro</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/mikerapin">Mike Rapin</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/chris_lawley">Christopher Lawley</a> decided to have an "intervention" for me.</p>
<p>We recorded a podcast and this is what came from it. We dive deep into consistency and dealing with imposter syndrome. It gets real. I really hope you enjoy this podcast because it was a lot of fun making this one!</p>
