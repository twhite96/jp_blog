<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/05/02/world-press-freedom-day-heres-our-bipartisan-call-protect-journalists/">Steve Chabot and Adam Schiff writing for The Washington Post</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As members of Congress, we swear an oath to defend the Constitution, a pledge that includes protecting the First Amendment and its guarantee that the freedom of the press not be infringed. The prominence of this guarantee reflects the framers’ understanding that a press that could hold power to account was key to the success of the young American democracy.</p>
<p>History has proved them prescient, and the United States’ model of protecting the press has served as a beacon for other free countries. It also reinforces our responsibility to stand up for press freedom in nations where the simple act of reporting the truth can lead to imprisonment, assault and even murder.</p>
<p>On May 3, we mark <a href="https://www.un.org/en/events/pressfreedomday/">World Press Freedom Day</a>, an occasion to consider the indispensable role journalists play in a democratic society and to call attention to the hundreds of journalists around the world who are in <a href="https://cpj.org/data/imprisoned/2017/?status=Imprisoned&amp;start_year=2018&amp;end_year=2017&amp;group_by=location">prison cells</a>, or have been attacked, injured or murdered, for the “crime” of reporting. The Congressional Freedom of the Press Caucus was <a href="https://votesmart.org/public-statement/170852/schiff-pence-launch-congressional-caucus-for-freedom-of-the-press#.XMsVj5hKiUk">founded in 2006</a> to serve as a voice for the safety and rights of journalists around the world, to make clear that Congress stands with them and to hold the powerful to account.</p>
<p>Regrettably, recent years have been some of the most <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2018/10/09/has-been-brutal-year-journalists-it-keeps-getting-worse/?utm_term=.5b79d9694637">dangerous</a> and <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/12/18/more-journalists-killed-2018-than-any-other-year-record-driven-unscrupulous-politicians/2346797002/">deadly</a> in memory for journalists. Far too many have been taken prisoner or lost their lives in attempts to report news from such places as <a href="https://cpj.org/data/killed/?status=Killed&amp;motiveConfirmed%5B%5D=Confirmed&amp;type%5B%5D=Journalist&amp;cc_fips%5B%5D=AF&amp;cc_fips%5B%5D=SY&amp;start_year=1992&amp;end_year=2019&amp;group_by=year">Syria and Afghanistan</a>. And in a world where authoritarianism is on the rise, journalists are often caught in the crosshairs of regimes intent on restricting access to information to better control their populace.</p>
<p>We see it in the brutal assassination of Post contributing columnist <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/global-opinions/wp/2018/10/06/read-jamal-khashoggis-columns-for-the-washington-post/">Jamal Khashoggi</a>, who was murdered by agents of the Saudi government for his criticism of the crown prince and the kingdom.</p>
<p>We see it in Myanmar, where two <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-journalists-explainer/facts-on-the-arrest-of-reuters-reporters-wa-lone-and-kyaw-soe-oo-idUSKBN1EY2S4">Reuters reporters</a>, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, were sentenced to seven years imprisonment for their reporting on the genocide perpetrated against the Rohingya people.</p>
<p>We see it in Venezuela, where the regime of Nicolás Maduro has employed violence, arrests and intimidation against independent media organizations.</p>
<p>We see it in Russia, where the Kremlin has mastered the art of spreading disinformation as a geopolitical weapon, while simultaneously implementing draconian laws to stifle dissent and free expression within its borders.</p>
<p>Violence and intimidation of journalists has also struck close to home. Last June, five staff members of the Capital Gazette were<a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/bs-md-gazette-shooting-20180628-story.html"> gunned down</a> in their Annapolis newsroom. In its <a href="https://rsf.org/en/ranking/2019">latest report on press freedom</a> around the world, the group Reporters Without Borders downgraded the United States to a “problematic” country. Just as we decry violence against journalists in other countries, we must speak out against attempts to stifle and intimidate the free press within our borders.</p>
<p>Threats to independent journalism are the canary in the coal mine — they signal a toxic environment for democracy writ large. As the leader of the free world, the United States has a duty to speak out on behalf of journalists who risk their lives to report the news. The truth must not, and cannot, be silenced by a censor, a prison cell or a bullet.</p>

<p>The video in this article is also something everyone should watch today.</p>
<p>It's easy to take news for granted and even poke fun at it like how <em>The Daily Show</em> and <em>Last Week Tonight with John Oliver</em> do, and I think those are great examples of satire and parody. That said, what people don't always remember is that the truth comes at a cost, and sometimes that cost is the lives of journalists.</p>
