<blockquote><p>Back in December, when I realized that the App Store was going to turn 10 in July, I knew that I wanted to celebrate the event with something special. I don’t typically like to dwell on anniversaries, but a decade of App Store <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/07/app-store-turns-10/">is a big deal</a>; I felt like both MacStories and <a href="https://appstories.net/">AppStories</a> were uniquely suited not just to nostalgically commemorate the App Store’s humble beginnings, but to tell the stories of the people whose lives were changed by it over the past 10 years. I wanted to involve the entire MacStories team in this project, and I wanted to reach out to developers who were there in the early days of the App Store as well as those who started making apps in recent years. And I wanted this special event to be at the intersection of longform articles and in-depth podcast conversations, with a healthy mix of stories about the history of the Store, a celebration of its accomplishments, and a critical look at its past missteps and potential for future changes. So, sometime in January, we began planning all of this, and we got to work.</p>
<p>The result, which I’m incredibly happy to announce today, is our <a href="https://www.macstories.net/tag/app-store-10/">App Store at 10 event</a>. Starting today for an entire week, we’re going to publish 1–2 feature stories on the site each day, which will be aggregated at <a href="https://www.macstories.net/tag/app-store-10/">this event hub page</a>. Additionally, there will be one special AppStories episode each day for a total of six interview episodes by the end of the week.</p></blockquote>
<p>If there is any site that should be covering the App Store’s 10th anniversary it is MacStories. <a href="http://twitter.com/viticci">Federico Viticci</a> and his team have done <em>amazing</em> work over the years covering apps and indie developers. Not to mention the longform research projects that are incomparable to anything else out there. I can’t wait to see what comes from them in the coming days.</p>
<p>Congratulations <a href="http://macstories.net">MacStories</a>, here’s to another 10 years.		</p>
