<p>Andy Nicolaides writing for <a href="https://www.thedent.net/2019/08/07/whats-in-a.html">The Dent</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the big questions I asked myself before moving my blog from Wordpress to Micro.Blog recently was ‘what would I call it?’ The name <strong>The Dent</strong> was kindly offered up to me by <a href="https://twitter.com/zcichy">Zac Cichy</a> after I tweeted about wanting to find some kind of identity to my tech blogging. The fact I didn’t come up with it myself frees me to say that I, personally, think it’s a pretty great name. While the name could mean many things, the six colour header and quote mark it as clearly Apple / Tech related.</p>
<p>The other alternative was to use <a href="http://andynicolaides.com">AndyNicolaides.com</a>, which I still own, but am not currently using. The unfortunate thing about this is my name is a bit of a mess and it would never stick in people’s minds for long, and if it did they’d soon forget how to spell it. It goes without saying that if you can’t spell a domain name, you certainly wont be going there very much.</p>

<blockquote><p>My issue, which is completely on me, don’t get me wrong, is that I feel I’ve painted myself into a bit of a corner with the name <strong>The Dent</strong>. While I have a love for technology, I don’t always want to talk or think about it. I feel that the name of this blog gives off a certain expectation, however. This feeling has held me back from posting more often, and of varying topics.</p>

<p>As someone who <em>did</em> make the decision to move from Rocket Panda to my own name, I think that if you feel like the name is blocking you from expressing yourself completely then change it to something else. I will say that you shouldn’t do this unless you truly are convinced the name isn’t “you” anymore. Rocket Panda was a one off name I came up with in the shower and liked it because it meant nothing, but over time I felt it to be a very weird website to explain to people and what the name had to do with it.</p>
<p>I changed my domain and not a single person seemed to notice or care. Maybe that is because not many people read this, but it was nice to not get so much flack for changing the name of my site.</p>
