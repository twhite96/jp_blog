<blockquote><p>
  If you use the excellent <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/things-3-for-ipad/id904244226?mt=8&amp;at=1000lHAf">Things 3</a> to organize your tasks, and Bear to organize notes, a clever workflow can turn them into the proverbial peanut butter and chocolate.</p>
<p>  (they go really well together)</p>
<p>  Created by Craig Eley, <a href="https://medium.com/@craigeley/leaving-bear-tracks-in-things-3d4fbf212128">this workflow</a> will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new Bear note</li>
<li>Ask you for a note title</li>
<li>Create a new task in Things using that title</li>
<li>Add a link to the related Bear note</li>
</ul>
<p>  Itâ€™s a powerful, quick way to use both apps to tackle your projects, thoughts, and just about anything else.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This seemed a bit redundant when I looked at this the first time. Then I got to thinking about all my tasks that have a long list of sub tasks, like my grocery list. So with that I decided to give this workflow a whirl because I have been wanting to make Bear a more useful app for me.</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/_BearandThingsAll.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
<p>This workflow is incredibly simple, but it works for me to get a task in Things as quickly as possible and then use that x-callback-URL to then get into Bear to expand on my new note/list.</p>
<h2>How it Works</h2>
<p>After running the workflow and making a title for the note, it creates a Bear note with the given input I wrote down in Workflow. Afterwards I am presented with the new task in Things 3 and I can open the note directly thanks to the automated link created in the task's note. From there I am ready to start listing all of my needed groceries.</p>
<p>So now, instead of a list of every single thing I need at the grocery store clogging up my task manager, I now only have a link of the Bear note where I can switch modes in my brain and start to focus on the task at hand, rather than the tasks I need to handle.</p>
<p>I plan to play around with this a bit more and see if there is anything I can do to make this workflow even more powerful for things like blog posts and podcast show notes.</p>
