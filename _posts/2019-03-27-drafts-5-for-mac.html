				<a href="https://nahumck.me/drafts-for-mac/">From Tim Nahumck</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>For many years,&nbsp;<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-5-capture-act/id1236254471?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">Drafts</a>&nbsp;has been&nbsp;the&nbsp;place on iOS where text starts. But for all of those years, there has been a missing component: a macOS counterpart.</p>
<p><strong>That ends today.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1435957248?mt=12">Drafts for Mac</a>&nbsp;has finally been released to the public. Last time there was a major release, I wrote the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/drafts-5-the-macstories-review/">Macstories Review</a>. But when it comes to a Mac and how best to integrate Drafts into the macOS ecosystem, I'm simply not the right person to do the review justice. But thankfully, one of my favorite internet people reached out to me privately about writing the review for it, and I was thrilled to even be asked. To be clear: they didn't owe me that, but it is honestly a nice feeling to feel respected within this community. They also reached out to Federico about writing for MacStories, and he agreed.</p>
<p>So, it's my pleasure to point you not here for a review, but over to MacStories where&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/RosemaryOrchard/">Rosemary Orchard</a>&nbsp;has written a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/drafts-5-mac/">review of Drafts for Mac</a>.

<blockquote><p>
The quest for the perfect text application &#x2013; for some of us it has been a lifelong goal, or at least it feels like it. I realised very early on in my computing life that I did not enjoy playing with formatting in Word or Pages, and when I discovered that Markdown provides the ability to make items&nbsp;**bold**&nbsp;or&nbsp;_italic_&nbsp;with just a few simple characters, I felt like I had finally found my text formatting holy grail.</p>
<p>Many years ago I discovered Drafts for iOS, and the idea appealed: you open the application and type. No creating a new file, or trying to decide what to do with the text before the thought is fully formed, just open, type, then decide. I frequently need to jot down notes, save links, and have found being able to write without thinking too much about where the words need to go, and how they're going to get there, is extremely helpful in today's world of constant interruptions.</p>
<p>Last year saw&nbsp;<a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/drafts-5-the-macstories-review/">Drafts 5 released for iOS</a>&nbsp;with even more capability than before, allowing you to truly customise it to be the text editor you've always dreamed of having. There was only one small but important snag &#x2013; no Mac version.</p>
<p>Today there is a Mac app. It is what many of us have been waiting for, albeit with a few missing features at the moment.&nbsp;<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1435957248?mt=12">Drafts for Mac</a>&nbsp;has landed.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s great to see two of my favorite people on the internet write about the new Mac app for Drafts 5. I played around with the beta and Greg Pierce, the sole developer of Drafts 5, has been doing a fantastic job with it. I can&rsquo;t wait to see more improvements to come on the Mac app as time goes on.		</p>
