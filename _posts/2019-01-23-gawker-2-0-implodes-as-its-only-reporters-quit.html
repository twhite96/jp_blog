<p><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/gawker-writers-quit-over-editorial-director-carson-griffiths-offensive-tweets-workplace-comments/">Maxwell Tani writing for The Daily Beast</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The two reporters said they decided to leave the new Gawker after Bustle Digital Group&mdash;which bought the shuttered Gawker.com domain and its archives in a mid-2018 fire sale&mdash;refused to oust Griffith over offensive workplace comments about everything from poor people to black writers to her acquaintance&rsquo;s penis size.</p>
<p>Kosoff and Breslaw said they met with human resources to complain of several instances in which they felt personally uncomfortable working with Griffith.</p>
<p>In particular, Kosoff&mdash;a former colleague and personal friend of this reporter&mdash;described to human resources an incident in which Griffith forwarded an unsolicited chain email showing the editorial director&rsquo;s friends boasting they knew the penis size of a prominent businessman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My one good memory from the...trip (besides meeting carson) is him in a swimsuit,&rdquo; one of Griffith&rsquo;s friends wrote, according to a copy of the thread reviewed by The Daily Beast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hung?&rdquo; another friend asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! Omg I feel like that is a question Carson would know :),&rdquo; Griffith&rsquo;s friend responded.</p>
<p>The two reporters also relayed to human-resources instances in which they believed Griffith&mdash;who holds a management role at the site&mdash;expressed an uncomfortably negative attitude on issues related to workplace diversity.</p>
<p>In a Slack message reviewed by The Daily Beast, Griffith seemed to brag to Gawker staff that she had gotten them out of a company-wide diversity training session, though neither Kosoff nor Breslaw had asked her to do so. The two ended up attending.</p>
<p>During one of Breslaw&rsquo;s interviews for the job, Griffith mentioned the snack selection at the office, and noted that she had a snack saved in her pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so poor person of me,&rdquo; she joked.</p>
<p>Kosoff additionally told HR of an exchange in which Griffith took a dismissive stance towards the recruiting of a writer who identifies as non-binary.</p>
<p>Kosoff, who was tasked with recruiting some new editorial staff, wrote in a Slack message that she was going to meet with a potential staffer &ldquo;who is a person of color and nonbinary (uses they/them pronouns).&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she returned from the meeting two hours later, Griffith initially laughed off the preferred pronouns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;lol is [name redacted] a girl?&rdquo; Griffith asked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wish I could say that this surprises me, but nothing about Gawker shocks me anymore. I hope both Kosoff and Breslaw find better work elsewhere.</p>
<p>As for Griffith, I am sure she is happy with all this attention. Most villains in media are when they get attention, good <em>or</em> bad.</p>
