<p><a href="https://blog.iconfactory.com/2019/04/now-you-know-how-it-feels/">Craig Hockenberry writing for Iconfactory</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Are you one of the many people affected by a MacBook keyboard failure?</p>
<p>If so, you now have the slightest hint of what it’s like to live with a disability. You can’t use a product like everyone else and it’s preventing you from achieving your goals.</p>
<p>Maybe you say “screw it” and <a href="https://twitter.com/JoannaStern/status/1110916811237871616">write an article for the Wall Street Journal</a> without those keys. Or maybe you hang on desperately to an old laptop (these words are coming from a MacBook purchased in 2013.) An external keyboard might be a temporary workaround.</p>
<p>But there is a clear distinction here: you have a course of remedy. You can take the laptop in for service or choose a different model. And while a failing keyboard is definitely a problem, it pales in comparison to someone’s permanent disability.</p></blockquote>
<p>Craig makes a great point here on this matter and I think that it is something many of us don't think about regularly, including myself. Apple has done great work for accessibility for those with disabilities and I hope they continue to do so. That said, the burden also falls on the developers, and I hope they are paying attention.</p>
