				<a href="https://angrybunnyman.com/blog/siri-shortcuts-part1">From AngryBunnyMan</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don&rsquo;t want to bury the lead so understand that this whole post is all about outsourcing my self-control. it is the next logical step in my evolution towards easy productivity, one influenced by my desire to remove as many decisions from my life as possible.</p>
<p>This method of self-management started many years ago when I decided I choosing clothes to wear every day was more taxing than I really wanted to deal with. And Steve Jobs entere(img)d my life with his sartorial minimalism and the the iPhone in 2007, both of which were revelatory for me.</p>
<p>Fewer decisions means more willpower available at any given time. More willpower means more focus. More focus means more useful work.</p></blockquote>
<p>This post I <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/workflow/comments/9ix58c/siri_shortcuts_to_outsource_my_self_control/)">found on reddit</a> really solidified my feelings on making my phone less distracting. I'm also a fan of the style this person uses.		</p>
