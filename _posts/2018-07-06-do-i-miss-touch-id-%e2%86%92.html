<blockquote><p>There are times where Face ID is annoying and I wish I could have Touch ID back. For instance, when your phone is sitting on a desk or flat surface you cannot unlock your phone unless you hover your head over the top of your phone. I know this might sound insignificant, but it is one of those things you don’t realize you’re missing until it is gone.</p></blockquote>
<p>This, along with price, was one of the biggest reason I decided to get an iPhone 8 Plus instead of the iPhone X. I know Face ID can be awesome, but when it doesn't work it can be an inconvenience you're not ready to endure. Maybe when Face ID 2 comes out I'll reconsider. Until then I will happily use Touch ID.		</p>
