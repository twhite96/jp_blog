<blockquote><p>If you’re like me, you may have been on iOS for years before you learned that when you select text and want to navigate the copy &amp; paste menu, you don’t have to tap the arrows to navigate – you can just swipe to the next page.</p>
<p>Normally I’d select text, try to accurately hit the tiny little next arrow, and usually missed and paste something instead of closing the menu. But when I was at WWDC, I saw someone go to share a bit of text and he… just…swiped on the list of actions</p></blockquote>

<p>After you select some text, have you ever tried to tap on that tiny little arrow on your phone to go to more options? I bet you’ve missed pressing it on more than one occasion. But thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/mattcassinelli">Matthew Cassinelli</a> your days of fumbling through the tiny text options are over</p>
<p>I have been on iOS for years and have never known about this little trick. It is almost as good as the precise cursor selection that iOS implemented not too long ago. It is like having the weights on your feet taken off before a run. Give it a try if you get a chance. One thing Matt recommends is to use it in Drafts and Workflow.</p>
<blockquote><p>For anyone who uses the Workflow action extension often and likes to run workflows on text using the text selection share menu, this is extremely handy. And for Drafts users, this also provides quicker access to the Dictate and Arrange actions available in that second page of the copy &amp; paste menu.</p></blockquote>
<p>So if you haven't already, give this neat trick a shot and let me know what you think <a href="http://twitter.com/iamjeffperry">on Twitter</a>.		</p>
