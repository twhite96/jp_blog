<p><a href="http://twitter.com/nahumck">Tim Nahumck</a> was kind enough to be a guest on this show to talk all about <a href="https://getdrafts.com">Drafts</a> 5. It had several occasions where my mind and Christopher's mind was blown on what we can do with the text editor.</p>
<p>Hopefully it can help you also learn some things with Drafts. If you have any questions or ideas feel free to <a href="https://jeffperry.blog/contact">contact me</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/iamjeffperry">mention me on Twitter</a>.</p>
