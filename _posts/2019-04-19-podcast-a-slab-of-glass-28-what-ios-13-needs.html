<p>Chris and I talk about our new purchases before diving into our main topic: what iOS 13 needs. We each had 6, okay 10-12, picks and we go into detail of our picks.</p>
<p>This episode was recorded literally the day before the 9to5mac leaks were released, so some of our things on our lists have been mentioned on this list but it in no way was a factor in picking the things we think iOS needs.</p>
<p>I may create a page where you can see both of our picks if people want to documented in writing.</p>
