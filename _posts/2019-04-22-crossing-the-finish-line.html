<p>I realized after talking with <a href="http://gr36.com">Greg Morris</a> for his podcast <em>And You Are?</em> that I am someone that is <strong>really good</strong> at getting an idea ready to launch, but pitiful at longevity. I can create a decent website, a logo, and come up with branding ideas for a new project. That said, the moment I make this project public for all to see and get this proverbial plane off the ground I'm lost.</p>
<p>It is why I've changed the look of my website so much or moved my domain over. Everything is because I have this plane up in the air, but now I have no clue what to do next. So instead of pushing myself to learn more and keep moving forward I decide to crash the plane into the ground and start over. I repeatedly lift off again and again because I know I am good at that, it's the unknown that scares me into taking the plane any further.</p>
<p>The same goes for other things in my life, like video games. I have created 6 different players on NBA2K19 all of which I have played at most 4 hours on in total. I create a character, get it set up and play a few games with them but I eventually just want to go back and make new players and try new ways to improve the creation of them. My intention quickly deviates from playing with the character I just created to creating the "best" character I can.</p>
<p>It's maddening to a lot of people who see that I haven't found one thing to focus on. I have lots of little things I work on simultaneously. It reminds me of something I saw recently from the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Essentialism-Disciplined-Pursuit-Greg-McKeown/dp/0804137382"><em>Essentialism</em></a> by Greg McKeown. What I saw was a diagram like this one, except instead of it being Focus it was energy. For me, focus makes more sense.</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/bbf8e-focus-chart.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>To sum this up, on the left side of this diagram of my focus with a lot of different things I am working on simultaneously. The arrows indicate how far I get into each one of them. I only have so much focus to give and if I spend all of it on lots of different things I won't get very far in them. On the right side is a different story. I focused on <em>one thing</em> and got much further than I did compared to the image on the left. When I saw this diagram for the first time it was one of those things that just clicked in my brain and never let go.</p>
<p>I have always been someone that does the left side of this image. I get an idea, then another idea, and then another. I decide that none of these great ideas are worth keeping in my pocket for later and I just start doing them all at once. Eventually, after some time has passed, I have gotten little done on all of these different projects. Whereas if I had decided to do one at a time I would have completed them all faster and I would have given each project the focus it deserves to be better.</p>
<h2>My Solution</h2>
<p>I am trying to be more mindful of this diagram and making it something that I consciously make a habit. Here are a few things I am doing to make that happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>I pick one thing to work on at a time as opposed to many. No new projects are started until I finish the one in progress</li>
<li>I am keeping all of my ideas on a separate area in Drafts for later</li>
<li>I am setting deadlines for myself to help keep pressure on the things I am working on, which in turn helps me finish things faster so I can work on something new before I get burned out</li>
<li>I have made this diagram my new home screen</li>
</ul>

<p>As someone that is a habitual offender of starting something but never finishing them I am excited to cross the metaphorical finish line more often. I am sure I will have more to say after a little while with this, but for now I am excited to make my work more intentional and less chaotic.</p>
