<blockquote><p>
Today I'm very excited to announce a book: Build Your OmniFocus Workflow. I've been hard at work on this for the last 3 months - but not alone. My fabulous co-author, Ryan Dotson, has been hard at work right along side me (admittedly with a timezone difference) - and we have 150 pages ready for you!</p>
<p>This book is designed, as the name implies, to help you build a workflow which works for you with OmniFocus - whether you've never used the app before, or if you've used it for years and just want to improve your setup. It is comprised of five sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First Steps</strong>: Getting OmnIFocus set up with a basic setup.</li>
<li><strong>Fundamentals</strong>: Walking you through the default perspectives, and expanding on your current setup - plus diving into settings.</li>
<li><strong>Advancing</strong>: Diving much deeper, including custom perspectives, creative uses for tags, review and onwards.</li>
<li><strong>Final Horizons</strong>: Honing your workflow to get the most out of your system.</li>
<li><strong>Our Workflows</strong>: Ryan and I get personal and tell you about how our setups work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout the book there are tips, notes, personal comments, and most important of all: activities for you to complete in order for you to create a set up which allows you to be productive and which will hopefully also allow you to feel like you're fully in control of your life.

<p>Rose has been doing amazing work as long as I have followed her and this is no exception. I bought this instantly and I am about halfway through it right now. While some of the things aren&rsquo;t new for me (I have been using OmniFocus off and on the past 5 years), it is still a great way to rethink how I use OmniFocus. I am taking this book as an excuse to start a whole new database and use the teachings of this book as my guide. So far, it&rsquo;s working great for me.</p>
