<p>Many people, like myself, work on an iPad because they love iOS and prefer it over macOS or Windows. They also do it because it inherently makes you focus on one or two applications at a time, leaving distractions behind.However, the human brain is great at finding things you can do to procrastinate from getting things done. If your main machine is an iPad, chances are you don&rsquo;t just have apps for your work on it. You probably have streaming services, music, games, and more to occupy your free time; but what if you find yourself using those apps instead of doing your important work? Today we are going to look at that and see what options there are to limit this kind of behavior.</p>
<h2>1. Delete Unnecessary Apps</h2>
<p>The simplest solution could be to remove the distractions entirely. Delete the YouTube app, the games, music and anything else you catch yourself using instead using doing the work that matters.</p>
<p>This can be great for people who live by the mantra &ldquo;out of sight, out of mind.&rdquo; However, this can&rsquo;t always be accomplished because we want to use these apps when we&rsquo;re <em>not</em> doing work and downloading those apps over and over again when we want them is too much of a hassle. If this is the case for you the next option could be what you need.</p>
<h2>2. Move Them to a Different Page on the Home Screen</h2>
<p>If you do find yourself needing to keep apps like YouTube, VLC, Twitter, etc. for various reasons you can still keep them &ldquo;out of sight&rdquo; by having it on a separate home screen.</p>
<p>This not only allows you to keep the apps for luxury time, but it also puts that barrier up so you have to tell yourself that you are going to this page because you want to do something that is meant for free time.</p>
<p>I am a big on the idea of having different areas on your devices for different goals you want to accomplish, so this is one I recommend to many.</p>
<p>But what if you aren&rsquo;t too keen on the idea of having a second page on the home screen? Then look not further than the next option you have.</p>
<h2>3. Nest Them all in a Folder</h2>
<p>If you are one of those types of people who hate a second page on their home screen (like me) you can still keep those distracting apps on the home screen but as its own folder tucked away for when you need those breaks from the hustle and bustle of work.</p>
<p>I suggest naming the folder something that reminds you what you&rsquo;re doing to yourself if you decide to go rogue on your big plans of work for the day. This is why I have a folder called &ldquo;Time Waste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The name can be anything you want but I recommend it be something that your brain will recognize as something you shouldn&rsquo;t be doing when you have something on your to-do list that needs to be done.</p>
