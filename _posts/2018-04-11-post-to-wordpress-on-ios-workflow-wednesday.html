<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_115299">If you blog on iOS, sometimes you want to send a quick post to your Wordpress site as soon as possible. The Wordpress app on iOS has come a long way in recent years, but when you are just sending a quick post dealing with the app can be cumbersome. This is where my workflow comes in.</p>
<h3 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_115302">What it is</h3>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_115305">This workflow is quite simple on the surface. However, thanks to Workflow&rsquo;s integration with Wordpress, you can handle even the most advanced options on every post you share. Things like the slug, post format, tags, excerpt, etc. are all options with this workflow.</p>
<h3 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_115308">What it Does</h3>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_115311">The Workflow starts by asking you the title of the post, which is then saved for later use as a variable.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_115314">After that it asks if you have a featured image for the post. This is an option of yes or no. If you say yes, it then opens up the Photos app to select the photo you wish to be the featured image.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/5C19A8B8-AF9B-494A-89E5-1C177873E1EA.png" alt="" title="" border="0" width="" height="" /></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_115320">Finally comes the fun part. Posting a blog post on Wordpress can be fairly easy, but this workflow also allows you to handle the minutia if you so choose.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_115323">Once you connect your Wordpress site to Workflow you&rsquo;re ready to start blogging your heart out!</p>
<h3 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_115326">Tweaks You Can Make</h3>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_115329">I have set this workflow to only ask for the categories and tags, but you can edit this workflow to ask you for more information if you want to have more control in each post you make. Simple go to the section you want to integrate with your workflow and tap the &ldquo;Ask When Run&rdquo; option. This will now ask you for an input every time you run the workflow.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_115332">I have also made this workflow with Rich Text in mind, if you prefer to write in Markdown you can add an action to convert rich text to Markdown if you would like. Everything I write is in Markdown, but I wanted to leave the option to you.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_115335">Also, if you prefer to select images in your iCloud or Dropbox folder instead of Photos, simple replace that action with a &ldquo;Get File&rdquo; action within Workflow.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1525151795126_115338">You can <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/167cea202de44651905a6e8700d161f2">download the workflow here</a>. If you have any questions feel free to leave a comment below, or contact me.</p>
