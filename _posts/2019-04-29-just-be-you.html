<blockquote><p>
  Something changed for me in the last year with my writing and based on feedback I’m getting it’s for the better. When I started blogging back in 2008 I stuck to a niche (at the time it was guitars) then I moved into technology a little while later based off the back of my freelance stuff.</p>
<p>  What I’ve found though in the last year is that I’m writing more personal (posts like this one) and not worrying about sticking to any sort of niche, just writing about what I’m passionate about or is on my mind.

  I guess what I’m trying to say as I’m starting to ramble is if you have a personal blog just BE YOU. Write about your passions be it the latest gadget you love or the most recent movie you’ve enjoyed.

<p>Like so many things Lee writes, this post spoke to me at my core. Recently, <a href="https://twitter.com/iamjeffperry/status/1119755487417913345?s=21">I spent time on Twitter</a> contemplating the name of my site. While doing so, I forgot that the name of my site doesn't matter if I don't know what I want to say on it.</p>
<p>My answer to that is this, Rocket Panda was created because I wanted to have a name outside the box Tablet Habit was putting me in, and I have slowly done so. I plan to continue to do so, and write about the things I want to write and not worry about my "niche" as much.</p>
