				<a href="https://thesweetsetup.com/whats-day-one-2018-edition/">What&rsquo;s In My Day One (2018 Edition)</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
I recently shared that if there were one single app I could hope to encourage folks to start using, it would be Day One.</p>
<p>Journaling has so many benefits, and Day One is an app that has made it easier and more enjoyable for me to maintain my journaling habit for years and years. In my little slice of the world it&rsquo;s this app that serves one of the few that can be used to genuinely change and improve your life.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This post really got me thinking about what kinds of things you can do with Day One, and made me reinstall it on all of my devices. I guess I&rsquo;ll report back after I try this course by Shawn.</p>
<p>Shawn Blanc is one of those guys that I buy products from on day one (no pun intended). He has made great courses for Ulysses and Things 3, and Day One has been on my list of apps I need to use more. So I&rsquo;ll be buying his course come May 22nd for sure.		</p>
