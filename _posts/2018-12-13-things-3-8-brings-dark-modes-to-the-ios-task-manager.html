				<a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/things-38-brings-dark-modes-to-the-ios-task-manager/">Ryan Christoffel writing for MacStories</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This fall when macOS Mojave introduced a systemwide dark mode feature, Things added support for the new mode in version 3.7. The iPhone and iPad versions of the app, however, were left out. A lack of feature parity across platforms is always unfortunate, but that was especially true this time around because our John Voorhees &nbsp;highlighted Things as having his single favorite dark mode implementation.</p>
<p>There's good news though: we didn't have to wait long for Things&rsquo; dark mode to make its way to iOS. Launching today in version 3.8, Things has added two different dark modes on both iPhone and iPad, one of which is suited particularly well to OLED iPhones.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cultured Code has been on my list for a while of developers that make the iPad great. Things 3 adding dark mode is one of my favorite things to see with Things 3. Sadly, I am still going to keep using OmniFocus strictly because it is the task manager that I consistently go back to when I am no longer "on the market" for task managers.		</p>
