<p>
				When I first started using the iPad full time the automation app Workflow was an up and coming app that allowed power users of iOS make some serious changes in how they did their work. Creating and finding Workflows to meet my needs were worth their weight in gold, and sometimes allowed you to make using your iPad more favorable than the Mac.</p>
<p>I, for one, felt that Workflow was so good at bringing together apps that don't normally talk to each other. Seamlessly moving items from one app to another all while maintaining the integrity of the file was a game changer. Workflow was the singular app that made me want to pull out my iPad over my Mac. That is until Apple acquired it.</p>
<p>When Apple announced the acquisition of Workflow my heart immediately sank, I felt that Apple was trying to squash Workflow and other automation applications for iOS. Instead, a new iteration of Workflow was created with some advanced features that control first party applications and settings.</p>
<p>Honestly, this news still hasn't sunk in that an app that is a unicorn in the iOS platform has gained so much capability. While I only have been using is for a few days, it is clear that Siri Shortcuts has revitalized my excitement and delight in working with iOS.</p>
<p>Siri Shortcuts hasn't changed much from its Workflow origins as far as how the app works and the things you can do with it, but something about this makes me more excited than ever to automate and simplify the complex things I do with my iPhone and iPad. Working in this app has allowed me to see the true potential of the iPad again and has made me leave my Mac unopened on my desk. I believe the reason I am so infatuated with this app is because the worry I had when Workflow was acquired has subsided. Between the announcement of the acquisition and the announcement of Siri Shortcuts I felt I was in between a rock and a hard place where I wanted to use Workflow's powerful tool but I also didn't want to sink time into an app that seemingly had a likely demise. I didn't want to use Workflow as a crutch to do my work on iOS because if Apple decided it would "sunset" Workflow my entire computing workflow would be null.</p>
<p>As we now know that was far from the case, and having that subconscious mental block leave me I have been using Siri Shortcuts every moment I can to build and play with the things that it can do. It reminded me of when I started Tablet Habit a year ago and had delight and excitement every time I would open my iPad, I finally felt that again with the iPad thanks to the revitalization of using powerful automation tools to make the tedious work on an iOS device as simple as a single tap.</p>
<p>I plan to share a lot of the Siri Shortcuts I have built over time, and if you have any questions or requests from me feel free to <a href="http://twitter.com/iamJeffPerry">contact me on Twitter</a> or <a href="mailto:contact@tablethabit.com">email me</a> and send any and all questions my way!		</p>
